{"ocr": "ELECTION RIOT AT BLACKBURN. There was a serious riot at Blackburn on the 10th inst. Business was suspended for a portion of the day, and there was great excitement manifested. The frequent visits of Mr. Murphy and his fellow-lecturers have caused great ill-feeling between the Protestant and Roman Catholic portions of the community; and to that may be attributed the occurrences on Saturday. A procession, headed by the Liberal candidates, and in which from 5,000 to 6,000 persons took part, started from a large vacant piece of land in the centre of the town. There were toil bands in the procession. The members of nine working men's reform clubs in the town joined in the demonstration, wearing pink, green, and white rosettes, an I there was a large display oi coloured silk flags. The most prominent flag, at the head of the procession, was one which was carried by Henry Hunt when he defeated the Earl of Derby in the contest at Presto a in 1830, and it was said that the Tories intended to break up the procession, and trample this particular flag underneath their feet. It was, however, found to be too well guarded, and in the early part of the proceedings no attempt durst be made to carry it off. While the procession was pass. ing a busy part of the town a band of roughs, about 500 in number, and headed by a band on horseback, made an attack upon a body of Irishmen in the pro- cession, and a general fight ensued. Stick, hats. and stones were flying in all directions, and the few police- men, who did their best to quell the disturbance, wero very roughly treated. The mayor of tho borough and the chief constable were spectators of a part of the disturbance. When they camo up they walked boldly into the midst of the melee, and collared one of the rioters. A number of rough-looking men did their utmost to cause irritation amongst those in the pro- cession by shaking in their faces pieces of blue and orange-coloured paper, and snatching at the rosettes Worn by the processionists. The policemen who wero near, two or three in number, were immediately set upon by the roughs, who were interfering with the procession, and a serious conflict took place. Ono man belaboured the head of a policeman with the handle of a thick walking-stick. A little further on a man named Preston, who, it was said, had been suffering from heart disease, became so excited by the disturbances, that he dropped dead in the street. Ho Was at once carried into a public-house near at hand. Another old man was found lying in the street in a state of insensibility, he having been injured, it was supposed, by a fall. His leg was found to be broken. Another disturbance of a serious nature occurred while a contingent was passing over a canal bridge. The processionists were set upon a number of men, who had collected a cartful of stones with which to pelt the Liberals. Two of their banners were dragged into the mud, and several persons were kicked and otherwise maltreated in a brutal manner. Further on in the evening a number of men smashed the windows of one of the working men's reform clubs, and suc- ceeded in making away with four handsome silk manners. Two persons are in custody for breaking the windows, along with several others for breaking the peace and assaulting the Liberals. Till late on the Saturday evening fighting was going on in almost every part of the town, and many persons have been Wounded by stones and other missiles and blows from sticks.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdOn the 12th inst. the prisoners who had been taken were charged before the magistrates, and, al- though some were discharged, others were remanded.

{"ocr": "ELECTION RIOT AT CARDIFF. After the declaration of the poll at Cardiff at midnight a mob of several thousand persons passed down St. Mary-street, where the newspaper offices are situated. Volleys of stones were flung at the windows of the Western Mail office, and one or two policemen were, it is said, struck. Thereupon a large body of county constabulary, who were drawn up in front of the Bute Statue, advanced with drawn staves and made a savage and indiscriminate attack upon the crowd. Sir Edward Reed, who was passing from the Liberal Club to his hotel, had a narrow escape. He and other gentlemen endeavoured to arrest the onslaught of the police, but in vain. Scores of persons, including several women, were struck down bleeding and senseless. While the fight was going on some one fired through the window of the editor's room in the Wextern Mail ofhee, the bullet passing over the head of Mr. Lascelles Carr, the editor. The mob rapidly increased until there were at least 10,000 people congregated. Rein- forcements of police were marched up by Chief Constable Hemingway, who, as the stone-throwing continued, gave orders to clear the streets. Another desperate fight ensued, in which the police were victorious. The Liberal Club, to which the wounded were taken, presented the appearance of an ambulance ward. Much indig- nation has been expressed against the police but they declare, on the other hand, that if they had not used strong measures their own lives would have been risked and considerable damage to property would have been caused. They allege that before they charged the crowd opposite the Liberal Club, where the greatest demonstration took place, they were assailed by empty bottles thrown from that establishment, and that many of their number were seriously injured by stones. The head constable was struck with a missile, which caused his hand to swell twice its size, and a policeman was carried into a newspaper office in an insensible condition\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda large stone having cut open his helmet and inflicted a severe wound upon his head. As many as 20 persons have been treated in the infirmary for injuries received in the riot. Some of the wounds were of a serious nature, and necessitated the detention of the patients. Many others had their injuries attended to at home. It is therefore impossible to give the exact number of the victims, but it is estimated that from 100 to 150 persons were more or less hurt. While one man was lying on the ground half insensible from the blow of a policeman's truncheon, another con- stable struck him in the face and knocked out one of his eyes. The man is now lying at the infirmary in a precarious state.

{"ocr": "CHIPPENFTAM ELECTION RIOT. The following letter has appeared in some of th< London and provincial papers. It was sent to th< Times and l)aily betes, but both those papers ex. eluded it from their columns SIR,- The Times of the 19th contains a lettei from Mr. W. Gerard Lysley, in which, without enumerating his other faults, be commits three blunders. First, he accuses the Mayor of having the hardi- hood to make a statement the very reverse of the fact.\" Secondly, he insinuates that the riot \"was well founded, was provoked, and was not destitute of a shadow o-f excuse.\" Thirdly, he alleges that the leading people on the side of the Mayor had the candour to acknow- ledge that the riot was provoked, and that they brought it on themselves.\" The details of the riot are now, or will be before many hours are over, the subject of judicial investi- gation at the Salisbury Assizes, and I believe it will be proved, as it has already been proved before the magistrates, that the facts are not correctly set forth in Mr. Lysley's letter, and that any acts committed by any of the supporters of the Conservative cause were purely acts of self-defence, and followed, and did not, (as stated by Mr. Lysley) forerun the out- break by the mob. I was not in Chippenham on the day of the riot, but I have been there since, and can testify that the work of destruction far exceeded any- thing I had expected to see. The houses of nearly all the leading Conservatives have been attacked with a savageness which, I hope, is without a parallel and my relatives and friends in Chippenham were for a time in as great danger as my friends in Newport during the great Chartist riot, when the bodies of nine or ten riotors lay stretched before the Westgate Hotel. Moreover, the houses were attacked in succession with such method and order, that the riot appeared to be rather a carefully planned attack for wreaking vengeance on all Mr. Lysley's opponents, than a spontaneous out- break and desultory attack upon those individuals who had rendered themselves conspicuous or un- popular by their bearing thro tgh the day. It is no new tiling for the opponents of Mr. Lysley to be reviled, mobbed, and assaulted by his admirers (I forbear to say supporters). I remember well the election of 1857, when Mr. Lysley was defeated in his contest with Colonel Boldero and Mr. Nisbet, and when a rather warm (I will not say intemperate) speech of Mr. Lysley was followed by the mobbing of some of the Conservatives and I also remember that upon that occasion one, at any rate, of the mob was taken in charge by the police, and was released at the earnest intercession of some of Mr. Lysley's most prominent supporters. Whilst, therefore, it would be very wrong to charge Mr. Lysley or the more respectable part of his sup- porters with having in any way encouraged the late dis- graceful riot, it is a question whether they are entitled to the credit of having taken any measures to guard against or prevent it but it deserves to be placed on record that several of them after the riot had com- menced did their duty nobly and neighbourly, stood shoulder to shoulder with those who, although their political opponents, were at the same time their fellow townsmen and their intimate friends-and have had the manliness to condemn the riot as a wicked and unjustifiable outrage. Some, however, have sort of halt apologised for the riot, as one pro- voked by the conduct of the Conservatives, and not altogether without a shadow of an excuse. This seems to be the tenor and purport of Mr. Gerard Lysley's letter, as also of a letter of an elector appear- ing in the Bristol baity Post, which contains a most unmanly sneer upon my aged father, the patriarch of the town\u00e2\ufffd\ufffda man beloved and esteemed by as many Liberals as Conservatives, who was bailiff (i e., mayor) of the borough when Sir Robert Peel was its member, and who has been three times mayor since the Municipal Reform Act. I challenge Mr. Lysley to say in what way my father, who is nearly eighty years of age, provoked a barbarous attack upon his house at night, when lying in his bed, unable to get out of the way of the stones which were pouring into the house, fifty pounds' weight having been thrown into the house within a quarter of an hour, and some eighty or ninety squares of glass broken. Z3 I challenge Mr. Lysley to say in what way my brother, Dr. W. H Colborne, provoked an equally savage assault upon his house, with four children under seven years of age asleep, and protected by Providence from the missiles of the mob. I challenge Mr. Lysley to say in what way the other gentlemen of the town provoked the still more savage assaults upon their houses, so that they ceased to be habitations and became ruins, after having just, and only just sheltered the fathers and mothers, the children and the servants, from nothing short of de- struction. And now a word or two with respect to the three blunders in Mr. Lysley's letter. Blunder the first: He attacks the Mayor, and yet does not venture to accuse the Mayor 01 any unfair or partial conduct. He thinks it proper to treat the Mayor as a mere partizan, and renders no homage to the Mayor as Mayor, and as a man whom his fellow- townsmen have honoured by constituting him the hrst man of the borough for his year of office. In committing this blunder Mr. Lysley has done something very much like insulting the whole town. Blunder the second Mr. Lysley attempts to show that the riot was well founded, was provoked, and W;JS not destitute of a shadow of an excuse. I think ] have fully exposed this blunder, and a serious one it is, for if the facts were as stated by Mr. Lysley, what excuse or justification would they offer for a murderous attack upon the houses of men whose only fault, if fault it be, consisted in their having dared to register their votes against Mr. Lysley\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdhaving this excuse for so doing, that the candidates for whom they voted had been their well-known friends and trusted allies for the whole or better part of their lives. Blunder the third: Mr. Lysley alleges that the leading Conservatives had the candour to acknow- ledge that the riot was provoked, and that they brought it on themselves. I am downright asto- nished at such a statement by Mr. Lysley. I can re- pudiate, on behalf of several of the leading Conser- vatives, any such acknowledgment\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe statement by Mr. Lysley fairly astounded them and I chal- lenge Mr. Lysley to name any leading Conservative who has made any such acknowledgment. And now, Sir, in conclusion, give me the credit of being actuated by no party feeling in answering Mr. Lysley's letter. I belong to a family who have been connected with Chippenham and its locality for centuries, and whose name has for a century, at least, been a household word in Chippenham, and I cannot therefore remain silent when my father and brother are not merely sufferers at the hands of the mob, but are the sub- jects of an attack from Mr. Gerald Lysley upon the Conservatives of Chippenham. I am quite sure that the interests of the Liberal party will not be ad- vanced by any half apology for this riot, or by any attempt to justify it; but that such deeds of violence and such acts of terror will be condemned wherever and under whatever circumstances they occur, by all right thinking men of every political opinion.

While the high sheriff (Sir Robert Brisco) was in the Town Hall making up the returns, the immense crowd outside got from one step to another till the two sets of partizans became involved in a furious and earnest fight. Potatoes and apples and even stones were thrown thickly, some striking the gentlemen on the hustings, and dozens of persons in the crowd showed bleeding faces. This lasted till the area immediately in front was altogether cleared but it did not cease with the clearance; for a number of the warmer partizans came forward and engaged in a fierce struggle, in which sticks, stones, and apples were thrown. Gas lamps were broken, and but for the precaution of the shopkeepers in putting up their shutters, all the windows in the Market Place must have been smashed in. The apple stalls were all pillaged, hundreds of club-like sticks were flourished, and the mob con- ducted itself in a manner which showed that it had cast off all restraint and decency,\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdthe entreaties of leading gentlemen on both sirles being of no avail. The disturbance had gone on for an hour, when the High Sheriff (Sir Robert Brisco, Bart.) reached his place and instantly the stones and sticks and powder and apples which bad been thrown about below were directed at the hustings, and in a few minutes the sheriff was struck several times, and was thickly dusted with soot about the face and head. Sir Robert in a hurried manner declared the poll to have been as follows :\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMr. W. N. Hodgson, 2,620; The Hou. C. Howard, 2,544 Mr. W. Marshall, 2,390.

Mr. Howard and his friends had previously left the hustings when the riot began to take a dangerous tun1. Mr. Hodgson, M.P., addressing his friends amid showers of stone?, said: Mr.High Sheriffand brother electors, I thank yen cordially for the distinguished manner in which you placed me at the head of the poll on Thursday. (Applause.) It is a proud position for any gentleman to hold-to be at the head of the poll for the Eastern Division of the county of Cum- berland, and to have been supported by a grealei number of the electors than have been polled for any other candidate since the division of the county in 1882, whether Whig, Tory, or Radical. (App.ause.; ( It will be my endeavour diligently to fulfil the duties you have imposed upou me and I shall, to the best of my judgment, follow the policy which will be most conducive to your welfare and to the well-being of the county at large. (Applause.) (A large stone here struck the hanging board immediately in front of Mr. Hodgson's face ) Gentlemen, it is of no use any man exposing himself to be hit with sticks and stones that is a sort of warfare I do not approve of. I shall, therefore, conclude by saying that I cordially thank you for the zeal, the ability, and the perseverance you have displayed in this election. You have estab- lished your own independence\u00e2\ufffd\ufffd(applause,)\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdand I trust you will long maintain it. (Applause.) Gen- tlemen, I thank you. Not one word of this address was heard by the mob, which, in fact, was now even more vicious taan be- fore and the fighting went on without any s gli of abatement. The fig-ht continued long after the hust- ings had been deserted; and a shameful and humilia- ting sight it was. That the mob came prepared for it there is no reason for believing, because it was very good humoured at the outset, but during the lon^ wait, its passions were excited bit by bit.\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdMr. Howard and his friends afterwards addressed the crowd from the Bush Hotel windows.", "word": "682", "description": "\u2026ELECTION RIOT IN CARLISLE.
