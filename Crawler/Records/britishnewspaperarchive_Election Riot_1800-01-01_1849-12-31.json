The Hon. Sir Edward Marmaduke Vavasour, Bart, proposed Sir George Strickland, Bart, a fit candidate. Mr. Warburton, of Sheffield, seconded the nomination. The Hon. Edwin Lascelles next proposed the Hon. John Stuart Wortley as a fit and proper person, &c. John Brooke, Esq., of Arraitage Bridge, near Huddersfield, seconded the nomination of Mr. Wortley. Lord Morpeth stood forward to address the assembled multitude, and was received by loud cheers from his friends. After referring in general terms to his connection with the present Administration, more particularly the Irish portion of it, he adverted to the government measures lie had supported. After hastily recapitulating those measures, he referred to the Poor Law Amendment Act, and with respect to it said that there were parts of the law which relate to its machinery, to the constitution of the Board of Guardians, and to the inspection and auditing of the accounts which he thought ought to apply here and every where, but he thought there was m that law itself ample power and elasticity for adapting and adjusting its provisions to particular circumstances and particular localities ; and all he could add was, that if those provisions, upon experience, stood need of being further extended or more closely defined, or if the existing regulations should have been proved to have been pushed on vexatiously or oppressively the districts where they are needed, or forced down where they are not needed, he should ready as Mr. Wortley any one else to promote inquiry. (Very loud laughter, cries of Inquiry!\u201d What, by another Commission?\u201d \u201cAnother job.\u201d) At this moment most terrific conflict commenced between the two rival parties, the Blues and the Yellows, but closely were the combatants mixed, and so sudden was the affray, that it was impossible to say which party were the aggressors. The contest was commenced, with slight sticks, but soon assumed a fiercer and sanguinary character; thick branches of trees, as well as the poles of the colours and banners, serving as more efficacious and deadly instruments for the gratification of their reciprocal animosity. Heads laid open, and faces disfigured with blood, met the eye in every direction. The blue party having been driven up an adjoining lane, appeared to have taken the opportunity of their temporary dispersion to arm themselves with bludgeons, and having formed themselves order, again charged upon the orange party, and completely routed them. Along oneside of Wood-slreet, where the hustings were erected, runs parapet wall of brick-work, separating the street from an adjoining field, about eight or ten feet lower than the ground, which had. till the movement we are describing, contained several thousands of the orange party. Many thousands of the same party were also engaged the dreadful conflict which was going on the street; these latter rushed tumultuously and precipitately across the wall into the field below. In this rush, considerable part of the wall gave way, and unfortunately its materials furnished the retreating party with the means of renewing the warfarein mode which most seriously involved the safety of all within reach of their dangerous missiles. They armed themselves with brickbats, breaking them in halves for the convenience of throwing them, they discharged them with furious effect, and in some instances with too sure an aim against all within their reach. The Blues now retaliated with the same weapons, availing themselves of another brick wall in the neighbourhood of their position for a supply of ammunition. The Orange forces were again seen mustering in immense strength in the distance, and without much delay they presented themselves in huge and threatening mass at the end of Wood-street, filling the area of the High-street and Market-place. Some skirmishes took place between detached parties, but speedily the orange body rushed forward with overwhelming impetuosity, driving the Blues before them and taking possession of their positions. These ferocious men, elated their success, seemed determined to spare neither friend nor foe. Showers of stones came incessantly pouring into the hustings, and the situation of all persons there became imminently perilous, the more so as no apparent means of escape presented themselves, for it would have been almost certain destniction to have attempted to make a retreat from the ground while either party remained upon it. During the whole of the conflict, tlie proceedings of the election were completely suspended ; but now it became evident that it would be necessary to terminate them altogether, in order to stop the shedding of human blood. The High Sheriff hastilydeclared that show of hands should be dispensed with, and that poll being demanded on behalf ot' all the candidates, should take place Thursday morning. A rapid and general retreat was then commenced from the hustings. It happened providentially that an open space was left along the back of this temporary building, which opened upon the roof of a vestibule attached to the Court house. Through thisopeninghundredssqueezed themselves. But even this asylum proved insufficient, and showers of brick-bats still continued to descend there, and many persons were severely wounded. No resource was now left save force way into thecourthouse, and this was effected smashing the windowsashes, and by leaping from considerable height into the body of the court. Into adjoining chamber manv wounded persons were conyeyed, and the gashes which thev had received were temporarily dressed. In about an hour after this period, we were enabled, by making a considerable detour, to get out of the town, matters for the moment being more tranquil, and the High Sheriff being the act of addressing the surrounding crowd, for the purpose of endeavouring to restore order. Not less than fiO.UOO could have been engaged one time in this fearful battle. ", "word": "1071", "description": "... ELECTION RIOT AT WAKEFIELD.

In froot j they came up to the Blue partv, and what first observed was, that they pulled the blue colours from the hat* of those who wore them ; this small band had yellow roloors; a scuffle ensued; the parties closed, and from that circumstance could not see any blows struck with sticks; tew some the party had sticks In their hands\u2014 he meant some of Vallow party; those sticks were common walking-sticks. Ill* attention was particulnrly called to the party coming up the street hv the chief constable, who was behind him, and desired him to semi body of constables request the band would come the other way was too late, however, to effect this j there was one gentleman the Blue parly standing the stm t the time, with stick In his hand and blue card hi* bat; he wished lie could have found that gentleman, tor his conduct was admirable, order that might have asked him to assist in giving evidence upon that inquest ; stood upon the defensive, and he was neither struck himself, nor struck others: he remained the middle of the street, with his arms folded, and on ash stick in his lumd, until the Blue party returned from the yard of the Woodman Inn ; he mentioned this because if theat'ack had been a very ferocious one that gentleman could not have maintained his position In the middle of the street ; the Blue party on being hustled, for saw nothing more Ilian fhut, ran into the yard of the Woodman ; they afterwards returned, armed with sticks, and drove all before them after few minutes adjourned court until Thursday, the day of polling ; and left the hustings, to endeavour to put stop to the riot mixing with the crowd and addressing them went Into the streer, and was knocked down by a paving stone, which struck aim In the back ; was also struck by stick on the shoulder, and a brick on the thigh, but could not tell the parties wl\u00bbo attacked him; this time the Yellows only were In the street; indeed other colour for the rest of the day ; he left Wakefield quarter past three o\u2019clock ; was not able apjieul to the people for show of hands account of the disturbance; the oil agreed to demand o poll, in order that the court might Instantly adjourned ; after having been struck as had described he went into the coo* t-hoH.se, here he remained for half an hour, and then went again the hustings, recommending them to disperse, which they did. a Juryroun resistance had l*ecn offeicd the Yellows while going Ihe street hud ; )i\u00ab thought from their manner that this party of Yellows must have been intoxicated ; he could form ftlcuof th\u00ab number of the Blue party who came out of the Woodman yard; they formed very large party. Charles John Brandling, Ksq., magistrate, was next examined, and staled that tbe time Lord Morpeth was-peaking observed a great pressure the Iron railing iu front of the hustings, wh'cb somi after gave way, and lie thought at the moment that several persons must have been severely injured by it; soon after this he suw band Yellows coming Wood-street, walking four a breast; when thev got up the Bines the hand halted, and the persons with it forced their way amongst tha Blues, flourishing their sticks above their heads, and pulling the cards out of the hats of the Blues ; several of the Yellows then struck the Blue* some apparently violent blows with their sticks, end tha latter retreated; there were this time two or three other parties in the crowd fighting with their fists aad sticks also. Witness called out to them keep quiet; soon alter saw the Blue partv come forward with sticks. The fight became general, and Glows were struck on both sides. directed thecoasUblcs to go forward, and portion of them did so; the Yellows, however, had retreated, and in conjunction with another magistrate (Mr. Carr) got between the two parties, and saw stones and brickbats flying in every direction from one party to the other: at this time the two parties were about fifty yards asunder, and, standing between them, heid up his hands and called to both lartivs for God s sake to desist, or lives would lost, and that must read the Riot Act directly; the throwing of stones then ceased on the Bine side, far ha could observe; this time had seen eight nin\u00ab* people lying on the ground, much hint, and some of them profusely one was senseless and whs supported some persons who were trying to assist him ; another was groaning heavily, and blood was streaming from bis head ; did not know any of them, indeed ha had no time to look them ; held up his little hook, which contained the Riot Act, and called out, Desist, desist,desist!\u201d walked down the street; was struck stones on the hip and the leg; when got within ten or fifteen yards of the Yellaw party stopped, and began read the Riot Act, when they gave loud yell, and brickbats commenced flying again one struck him a severe blow on the breast, took Ins breath away, and ha felt back into the arms of one of the special constables it some minutes before could speak again, when finished the Riot Act, and concluded saying \u201cGod save the Queen as loud he could. Mr. asked him where were bis constables, and he said could not tell, for they had all b\u00aben dispersed ; some said \u201c Send for military;\u201d and perceiving that the riot was fust increasing, and that windows were breaking every direction, he went to the Stofford Arms, and scut an express Itevvsbuiy for the military; on subsequently hearing that the military were Leeds, and not Dewsbury, lie sent another express there then went into Wood-street, and found the parties fighting much ever, though now they were skirmishing, being no longer solid body; called out to hern be quiet, the military had been sent for, and would be there very soon; afterwards rode meet the military, mid told Captain Hose, the commander of the troops, that the town was in possession of the mob, and that had read the Riot Act; on arriving town they found that the riot had ceased, and the military were sent into billets; saw roan of the name Walnwright near the police-office before left the town, and this Wamvvrigltt hooted and hollowed the mob him; hod him tak\u00abn into custody, and was then informed that hud been very active in the riot; found that was released another magistrate, at which Mr. Carr and himself were\u2018much surprised, and that he was acting in the capacity of special constable. John Francis Carr, E.\u00abq., a magistrate, corroborated evidence of Mr. Brandling. Mr. John Barn, chief constable of Wakefield, also deposed similar facts. The Honourable James S. Wortlcy was then examined, and gave u description of the occurrences similar that which hud been given by the previous witnesses; hud beei* very active in endeavouring quell the riot, and hod Js-tn several times struck by stones and other missile*; could not recognise anv one engaged in the fray; at one period thought his life was in danger, and Hung back a brick which had previously knocked down a man near him when flung it back, it struck one, but it had the effect of deterring the mob from following him through the Iron railincr.

{"ocr": "ELECTION RIOT YORKSHIRE. Yorkshire (West Riding.)\u2014 Wakefield. Monday Night.\u2014The nomination of candidates for the representation of this division ot the county took place to-day. At a very early hour the usual symptoms of a county election began to manifest themselves. Shortly after eleven o'clock the High Sheriff r ' * the usual formalities having been disposed of, Sir '' \u00b0d proposed Lord Morpeth, and Mr. Jonathan Acroyd seconded the nomination. Sir E. V avasour proposed Sir George Strickland, and Mr. Warbnrton, of Sheffield, seconded the nomination. The Hon. Edwin Lascelles then proposed Mr. Wortley, and Mr. John Brook seconded the nomination. Lord Morpeth then came forward, and was received with loud applause by his friends, and with disapprobation by the blues. In the course of his address he said\u2014 When my non one \u201et talks in his address of resisting the introduction of the Poor-laws into the West Riding- Wortley.\u2014-Those words are not in mv address, and should feel sorry to have it supposed that I could use any words which could be construed to the meaning that I wished to promote a violent resistance to tbe law of the land. At this moment a most terrific conflict commenced between the two rival parties, the blues and the yellows, the former espousing the cause of Mr. Wortley, and the latter that of Lord Morpeth and Sir G. Strickland, but closely were the combatants mixed, and so sudden was the affray, that it was impossible, beholding it from the hustings, to say which party were the aggressors. The contest was commenced, and continued for a considerable interval with] slight sticks, with which the combatants appeared to have been casually provided, rather than deliberately armed for any purpose of premeditated hostility, but the contest soon assumed fiercer and more sanguinary character ; thick branches of trees, as well the poles of the colours and banners, which were mutually wrested by one party from the other, serving as more efficacious and deadly instruments fir the gratification of their reciprocal animosity. In many places iright be seen individuals whose condition afforded indisputable proof of the savage determination of the contending factious. Heads laid open and faces disfigured with blood met the eye every direction. The blue party having been driven up an adjoining lane, appeared to have taken the opportunity of their temporary dispersion to arm themselves with tremendous bludgeons, and having formed themselves order, again charged upon the Orange party, and although unquestionably very much inferior in point of numbers, completely routed them. Along one side of Wood-street, where the hustings were erected, runs parapet wall of brick-work, separating the street from an adjoining field, about eight or ten feet lower than tbe ground, which had, till the movement we are contained several thousands of the Orange party. Many thousands of the same party were also engaged in the dreadful conflict which was going on in the street; these latter wben overpowered their opponents, rushed turaultuously and precipitately across the wall into the field below. Masses of men and women were seen to hurl themselves from the parapet desperately, the depth below and many evidently suffered severely from the wounds inflicted by their and merciless antagonists. In this rush, a considerable portion of the wall gave wav, and unfortunately its materials furnished the retreating party with the means of renewing the warfare a mode which most seriously involved the safety of all within reach of their dangerous missiles. The Blues now retaliated with the same weapons, availing themselves of another brick wall in the neighbourhood of their position for supply ammunition. At length they gained the advantage in this encounter also, and drove the discomfited Orange party before them, not only from the street and the field already mentioned, but also from the outlets adjomiug, and they now appeared complete masters of the field. But it was evident that the cessation of hostilities caused by this temporary success could not be of long duration. The Orange forces were again seep mustering in immense strength in the distance, and without much delay they presented themselves in a huge and threatening mass at the end of Wood Street, filling the area of the High Street and Market Place. Some skirmishes took place between detached parties, but speedily the Orange body rushed forward with overwhelming impetuosity, driving the nines before them in their and taking possession of their positions. These men, elated by their success, seemed determined to spare neither friend nor foe. Showers of stones came in - cessantly pouring into the hustings, and the situation of all persons there became imminently perilous, the more so as no apparent means of escape presented themselves. It may unnecessary to observe that during the whole the conflict the proceedings of the election were completely suspended; but it now became evident that it would be necessary to terminate them altogether, in order to avert the most awful consequences, and to put a stop to the shedding of human blood. renewed shower of brickbats brought the matter to an issue. The High-Sheriff hastily declared that a show of hands should be dispensed with, and that a poll being demanded behalf of all the candidates, it should take place on Thursday morning. A rapid and general retreat was then commenced from the hustings. To effect this a way was forced into the Court House, which thus became intensely thronged in the cour.se of few minutes. Into adjoining chamber many wounded persons were conveyed, and the gashes which they had received were temporarily dressed. Extraordinary Riot at Cambridge Election.\u2014 After the polling was over, and the mayor and candidates had left the cricket-ground, the Rev. Mr. Maherley addressed the crowd against the New Poor Laws, and as the Rev. Gentleman did not desist when requested by the police, he wa.s fatten Lito custody. The mob immediately attempted a rescue, when the Rev. Mr. Earnshaw.one of the pro-proctors ofthe University, whose duty it to assist in maintaining the peace, and who for that purpose has two constables appointed to attend him, rushed into the melee for the purpose of quelling the riot, but regardless of his official capacity, the police had the audacity capture him also. At night tbe popular indignation at the conduct of the police burst forth, and the windows aud gas lamps of the police station were broken. Before this, however, Mr. Earnshaw had been released the direct, remonstrances of the Vice-Chancellor, and for safety Mr. Maberly was removed to the town gaol; but the police had no warrant, tbe gaoler refused to admit the reverend prisoner, ami he was instantly rescued by the mob who carried him in triumph to the hustings, whence he harangued a tumultuous crowd. Election Duel Cheltenham. \u2014Major Chalmer, waited Thursday morning on Captain Craven Berkeley, with a message from Captain Younghusband, the effect, that as chairman Mr. Peel's committee he, Capt. Younghusband, considered that the epithet false,\" used by Captain Berkeley his committee room, was an epithet personally reflecting on Mr. Peel's committee, and requiring Captain B. to retract or apologise. Captain Berkeley replied, that believing his assertion to be true, he would neither retract or apologise, and immediately referred Major Chalmer to Captain Carrington Smith, his friend. A meeting took place in a field near Arle, and after an exchange of shots, MajorChabner withdrew his friend from the ground, expressing himself satisfied if Capt. C. Smith was, which was assented to by Captain Smith, he at the same time observing that his principal, Capt. Craven Berkeley, was not, and that he Captain B. insisted on keeping his ground without apologising or giving any explanation. ", "word": "1272", "description": "... ELECTION RIOT YORKSHIRE.

RECORD COURT. MONDAY\u2014THIRD DAT. Bolger versus Howhn. This was an action for assault and false imprisonment wherein Thomas Bolger, a child of tender years, was Plaintiff, and James Howlin, Esq. Defendant ; brought Patrick Bolger, Plaintiff\u2019s Father and next of kin. There were three counts in the declaration ; the damages were laid at \u00a35OO, and the Defendant p'eadtd the general issue\u2014Counsellor O'Hara opened the pleadings and Mr. Scott, K. C. slated the case. He said he had been culled on to state the Pirn, tiff's case, and to ask for compensation for the violation of personal liberty. The liberty of lh* subject, personal liberty dear every man ami none should be permitted to infringe on it but those warranted law. He called on the respectable Jury which he saw in the box, and who well Knew the nature and responsibility of solemn oath tbey had taken, when they should hear the facts which would be stated and come be. lore them in evidence, to protect that liberty ; however some of their facts may be conceived to extenuate the conduct of the defendant. The rights of the Plaintiff hare been violated by the defendant which an infraction ot the law that protects personal liberty also, and which will nut he suffered to be infringed on ; therefore it wasfft that violation of liberty he now sought for reparation lor the Plaintiff. Here the learned counsel entered into debil of ths circumstances which he humourously . faced in allusions to the celebrated electioneering character of the Plaintiff. The transaction, continued, had taken place at time of con. ideialde excitement, during a Conte'ted election ; lu which ma.tcrs the zeal amt activity of the Defendant was generally known, and in which t\u00bbok a warm and aotive part since came to years of maturity ; and the candidates whose oause were generally sure to successful. Hire, Mr. Scott dwelt considerably on the supposed change which hud taken place in Mr. 9 political views\u2014noticed the exploits at the Egg election most humourously, and the part he had then taken on what was called the popular side\u2014to which the impression was, he was opposed on (he occasion which was tha cause of the present trial and was conceived to be in opposition to the cause of those he had heretofore espoused. On the fint day of the .Election the Defendant, it sf'psartd, went to bring persons to vote on whom lie and oilier blanches his family conceived they had influence ; lie was met by some persons o, postil to him, bet and put on his knees some very persons whose cheers he had hitherto accustomed.

The Delrndant went to the house one Mitten and brought him and one Fortune to the house of his brother and detained them there all night. Next day he brought them in open carriage tlie way to Wexford arid when they came the length Pall Bolgei\u2019s house, the Father ul the Plaintiff, Defendant entered it ami found two children a woman therein. learned gentleman remarked that this part of his narrative brought tu his mind a humorous start had gone the rounds of the country, whirl) was that when the Defendant asked the children was their Father at home, one of them (the Plaintiff\u2019) replied he was not, that he was out beating Jemmy Howlin'' This if true he would call an indiscreet zeal, to endeavour to make child witness against its Father. The Defendant then brought the child from I lie house,' against which the woman, Ciieevem, who would be produced remonstrated. Tlie child wa\u00ab naturally alarmed, and cried ;he was kept for two months and would not be given up to bis Parents. 1 leave you, said Mr. S. to bear the la* tlie case from the learned Judge, after bearing which 1 think you will find it your duly to compensate my client for tins flagrant violation (lie law. He had no doubt but the proceeding was well intended on the part the defendant, but then be had no warrant ; security had been entered into before a Magistrate ; he brought tlie child to his, the Defendants, brother's house, Magistrate of the county ; thence to his own huuie in Wexford ; and from that to the Police Barrack. Remonstances came and it was cruel to keep ths child for so long a period from his Parents. 'His Defendant would not give him up, but tu give a colouring tu his proceedings lie bruugbt the chihl before a Magistrate but it was all to purposes* the child would not swear. Abho\u2019 the Plsiiililf is a child he should be compensated for this infringement of liis personal liberty ; but such compensation is not sought as woiiTd demanded or given to a grown person ; but such as may commensurate witliymireslimateuf natural liberty. He had not cast any imputation cn the character of Mr. Howlin, but he had right to exercise such a power ; and lie trusted the Jury would their duty and altho\u2019 the child might have had friends implicated ir. the attack on Mr. llowlm it was reason that he should be deprived o( bis liberty, and therefore his client had a right to sucli compensation as the transaction and citcunaslauceS warranted them in giving.

{"ocr": "ELECTION RIOT AT THE WEST RIDING OF ; YORKSHIRE. I AKEFi iFLtt, Monday Nfight.-The nomnination ofcandidatee for the representation of the WVest Riding was appointed to take place this day, but the proccedings have been interrupted in a most dis- graceful manner by some blue bludgeons-men. Amid the great ,ot;fosiol which prevailed it isa difficult matter to arrive at the t ruth ill every particular; but it appears thatthe Tory party entirely bearthebiamtcu. The Reformers(Orange) musteredin farstrong- er foirce than their opponents; and whilst Lord Morpeth was vpeakiig, the Buies, armed with bludgeons,attacked their opponents and drove them otithe ground which tbhyoccupiednearthe hustings. The Oringe, totally unprepared for such an attack, were at first driven over -very obstruction-walls, rails, and buildings ; they Iled in all directions ; and the part which Oastler, the rejected of Huddersfield, bare in this shameful scene of disorder was so con. ,picuous, that it will be a matter of legal inqiry. A warrant, it is said, has been issued against him as well as gainst theson of the rejected of Bradford, Mr. Hardy. The Reformers, thus wantonly ittacked, rallied their forces after some time, and arming them. *eloys with whatever they could lay hold of, advanced in a body against their Tory opponents. A regular fightcommenced, brick- bts, stones, and tiles flying in all directions. They fought with the most determined resolution; and the Blueswere driven off the groutd, and indeed from every street, and eventually either out of the towst, or they were compelled to seek for refuge in hiding places; for afterwards nrot a blue flag or ribbon was to be seen in any part of the town. Indeed, the Orange, wvho were soexasperated at Being thus shamefully attacked, seized, duritg the struggle, all the blte banners, whethercounposed of silk or satin, tore them into ten thousand pieces, broke the stafls, and used them as instruments of attack and defetice. During this disgraceful scene, when mis- siles were dying in every direction, Mr. James Stuart Wortley, the reiected of Halifax, who Was on the hustings, was severely hit, and bled very profusely. Many others were also struck, but the candidates escaped. The Tory candidate, however, the Ho-nn, John Wortley, wasplaced in a situation of great peril. But Lord MVorpeth, acting with the goodness of heart and disposition for which he is distinguished and beloved, and determined to do good for evil, acteil anoblepart. The noble lordand Sit George Strick- ?? bable that if they had not done sof-in the exasperated state into which the Orange were forced by the attacks of their opeonents- lie Would have been treated with the utmost severity, perhaps with loss of life; ais it as, however, he was protected by his honourable opponents. From this brief detail, it may be readily imagined what asieerie was presetited, and with an assembly, too, of upwards of 50,000 people. The proceedings on the hustings were stopped before Lord Morpeth had finished. The other candidates, of course, could not speak; nor was there any show of hands. The i nstigators of this disgraceful riot deserve the severest chastisement. For them there appears to be nojustification. They were not in the least provoked ; as the Orange party were peaceably disposed, and totally unprepared' for a hostile attack. But on the part of the Blues the same spirit was shown at Wakefield as vas witnessed at Leeds, where Mlr. Baines with difficulty obtained an hearing, and Sir William, Molessvorth could not be heard at all; and like- wise at Huddersfield, where, in consequence of a manifestation of the same feeling, the election was adjourned till next day. This is certainly a very bad beginning for the West liding, but probably ai orse remains behind, although it is to be sincerely hoped that in all the polling places the greatest precaution will be used to preserve I the peace by the respective authorities, and to stop the system of Blue bludgteons ; if not, the toss of life may be truly frightful, especially as there is presailett among large bodies of the people a feelingof hostility against the party who, in thisinstance, are the i aggressors. The first day's poll takes place on Thursday at the 4 sixteen polling districts. In tite mean tine, the most strenuous exertions are making by each party; and a contest of the most i determined character Will be carried forward, and with a feeling i too deepened by thelamentable occurrenceo' what has taken place at the nonination. Itseems, amid the present state of excitement, esserntially necessary that the peace should be preserved not only i at the several polling places, but at the declaration day on Monday I w.xt at Wakefield, already the scene of one riotous disturbance. I We regret exceedingly to have to state that one gentleman, Mr. I Carter, ofDemvsbury,sonofAMr. Jeremiah Carter, Coleman-street, I London, of the firm of Halliley and Carter, a young inan, received t a mortal injury during the riot, from which he died during the night. Several gentlemen received severe bruises, and even wounds, but we believe no other fatal case occurred. 1 MON^OUTHSHIRF ELECTION took place on Wednesday last at Monmouth, upon which occasion the two late inem- bers, Lord Granville Somerset and W. A. Williams, Esq., were re-elected without opposition. Lord G. Somerset was proposed by the Hon. Win. Rodney, and seconded by J. E. Rolls, Esq.; Mr. Williams was proposed by J. Vaughan, Esq. jun., and seconded by R. J. Blewett, Esq. M.P. for the Monmouth boroughs. At the conclusion, MIr. B. Hall, the late representative of the boroughs, having been loudly called for, addressed the electors. After the members had been declared duly elected, they, as well as the member for the boroughs, were chaired through the town, though the ceremony received a severe damper from copious showers of rain which fell at the time. MONNJOUTH.-The cause of reform has obtained a most glorious triumph in the contributory boroughs of Mon- moudishlire, in the return of Mr. Blewitt, a gentleman, who in or out of parliament will on all occasions prove himself an able, consistent, and talented champion of the rights of the people. The following was tle final state of the poUl:- BLEwinT. BAILEY. Monmouth .95 1 Newport .3i7 145 Usk ?? ?? 28 67 440 S Majority for Mr. Blewitt, 54. This result is exceedingly gratifying, as exhibiting the progress of liheral principles since the last general election, when Mr. I-all obtained his seat (which was then, as now, contested by Mr. Bailey) only by a majority of four.

In the House of Commons on Friday, Mr. Hume made a great noise about a riot alleged to haTe taken place at Clitheroe, which was not suppressed without some severity by the military. lives, however,\u2019 were lost; and owe it to the gallant service employed in putting down the riot 'to say, that, from all the statements which we have seen, no more rigour was employed than appears to have been necessary for the restoration of the pubtic peace. We may here shortly state the facts of the case. Mr. Irving, who has oeen so long a distinguished member of the House of Commons, proceeded on Tuesday, accompanied some gentlemen, to canvass the town of Clitheroe. The pupils of the \u2014the brickbat, bludgeon, and pavmgstone men\u2014proceeded'in due order to receive Mr. Irving after tneir accustomed fashion, with a design, no doubt, of murdering him, as, at no great distance of time or place, the pupils of the Times had murdered Mr. Ljgh (viz., at Wigan, last summer). We shall quote the Blackburn Gazette, as adopted by the Globe : The gentlemen took alarm, and made their way out of the town, with all convenient speed. On theu: takingjto flight, the crowd pelted them with stones, which caused considerable damage to the carriage; but, we believe none of the gentlemen were injured.\u201d Mr. Irving, it would seem, resolved not to yield without a struggle to the brickbat, bludgeon, and paving-stone legislators, the exclusive right of canvassing the town Clitheroe. He resolved to return, but took the necessary precaution of applying to the magistrates to secure his personal safety and the tranquillity of the town. The magistrates reinforced themselves by a detachment of fifty dragoons, who instantly upon their appearance were assailed by the mob. A scuffle then followed, in which some of the paving-stone legislators were wounded, more or less severely, and one person had bis arm broken. This is the plain tale, as extract it from vast mass of affected jargon in which it is enveloped by the Globe and the Blackburn Gazette. But, if the use of the means recommended by the Times, of the brickbat, bludgeon, and paving-stone, be permitted still to continue, what gentleman, what person of rank, wealth, or knowledge, whose feelings are not precisely accordant to that of the rabble, will venture to offer himself at any election Formerly that animal intrepidity, which many a truly' brave man wants, and which is rarely founa in the student, the commercial man, or the statesman, was not always necessary to the obtaining seat in parliament, but now, if the Clitheroe system is to become universal, and indifference to blows, and all sorts of brutalities will be requisite for a candidate to sit in St. Stephens as essential as for a candidate for the honours of an Irish fair or those of the ring at Moidsey-hurat.

It appears that, throughout the day, he was very principal leader in the disturbances which occurred; and during the firing, displayed an uncommon degree of hardihood, which shall slalalt happened that while the Riflemen were firing out of the Court-house windows, their bayonets being fixed, two of them dropped on the flags outside.

At this time it was proved that the firing became hot that almost all his parly fled. He took up however the second bayonet and escaped with the same success before. He then returned a third time to the windows, with what intention it does not appear. He crept under the window; one of the witnesses supposed he was peeping in. While there was noticed one of the soldier\u2019s who were in the habit of coming to the corner of Court-house-lane, who fired at him and gave him his death wound; the unhappy and thoughtless young man then staggered off in on opposite direction to what he had come.

The following are tin) principal facts upon which reliance can be placed, that we have been able to collect.\u2014A short time previous to the clos ing of the pulls, some shoving and scuffling took place between the two parties, in their endeavours to got their voters to the western window of tlio Commissioners' ilall, in which the election was held, which resulted in the Jackson men, who at that moment happened the weaker party, being driven from the window, and their lamps being broken. They retreated, and the fight was shortly afterwards renewed with clubs and stones, to the east of the Hull, where the Jackson men had hickory pule erected, and where they had two tents, which served as thsir head-quarters. The tents were demolished, and the hickory pule cut down, is alleged by 101110 the Jackson men, with the intention of using it for the purpose of forcing the Hall, and carrying away the ballot boxes, us bad been previously threatened. At Ibis time one or muro muskets weru fired, and several of tho Jackson men were seriously hurt. Intelligence of what was going on was speedily conveyed to Southwark, upon which number of persons hastened from thence to Muyamensing. On the appearance of this reinforcement, the contest was renewed, and tho forced into the house. About this time, a strung party from the Northern Liberties, and Spring Garden, with their lamps, and band of mnsic, appeared on the ground. They had previously visited the residence of Gen. Ash, the democratic bead quarters in Spring Garden and the city, cheering their friends at their victory, but it does not appear they had any knowledge of th? disturbance at Moyamensing, cntil they arrived in tho vicinity. The party in the house finding themselves closely pressed, had recourse to their muskets, of which fifteen or twenty stand were in then possession. How or where they procured them we have not heard. They fired repeatedly from the windows and roof, and wounded fourteen or fifteen persons, several of them severely. The Jackson party pressed on, and obtained possession of the boose, and drove out their opponents. It appears that in this last attack one or two of them had muskets. They took out tho furniture, rnd burned it near the liberty pole erected in front, then set fire to the building. An alarm fire was instantly made; the State House bell was rung, and the fire companies hastened to the spot, but were not permitted to use their apparatus, until the Liberty Pule was prostrated, which took some time, consequence of their not having proper tools With which to cut it down.

Others had their coat 9 torn off their backs, besides being pelted with stones. Mr. Pratt, of tilentarkie, was severely struck under the eye with a stone ; the wound bled so profusely as to sicken him, and was obliged to be put to bed. Mr. Landale's head was cut with stone, although protected both by a crape and his hat. The sheriff, Mr. Clephane, who, with all the constabulary force, could scarcely be protected to the inn, was pelted, and struck with a stone behind the ear. Se veral voters came to town during the day, and prudently went off; amongst others General Balfour. The General returned next day, expecting the town to be quiet, and after voting, he with difficulty got to a neighbouring house, where he was kept prisoner for hours, and escaped at last under the protection of some of the captain's party.

Shortly after eleven o'clock the High Sheriff arrived and the usual formalities having been disposed of, Sir F. Wood proposed Lord Morpeth, and Mr. Jonathan Acrnvd seconded the nomination. Sir E. Vavasour proposed Sir George Strickland, and Mr. Warburton, of Sheffield, seconded tbe nomination. The H-m. Edwin Lascelles then proposed Mr. Woitlev, and Mr. John Brook seconded tbe nomination.

Mr. Wortlev\u2014Those words are not address, and should feel sorrv have supposed that I could use any words which could he construed to the meaning that I wished to promote violent resistance the law of the land. At this most terrific conflict commenced between the two rival piities, the blues and the yellows, tlie former espousing the causa of Mr. Wortlev, and the latter that of Lord Morpeth and Sir G. Strickland, I hut closely uere the combatants mixed, and sudden was the affray, that was impossible, beholding it from the hustings, to say which partv were the aggressors. The contest was commenced, and continned for a considerable interval slight slicks, with which the combatants appeared to have been casually provided, rather than deliberately armed for any purpose premeditated hostility, but the contest soon assumed fiercer and mure sanguinary character thick branches of trees, well the poles of the colours and banners, which were mutually wrested the one party from the other, serving as more efficacious and deadly instruments for the gratification of their reciprocal animosity. many places might he seen individuals whose condition afforded indisputable proof \u00ab>f the savage determination of the contending factious.

Along one of Wood-street, where the hustings were erected, runs parapet wall hrick-work. separating the street from adjoining field, about eight or ten feet lower than the ground, which had, till the movement we are describing, contained several thousands of the Orange party. Many thousands of the same party were also engaged tbe dreadful conflict which was going in the street ; these latter when overpowered by their opponents, rushed and precipitately ncross the wall into tlie field below. Masses of men and women were seen to hurl themselves from the parapet desperately, regardless the dangerous depth helow, and many evidently suffered severely from the wounds inflicted h.y their indiscriminating and merciless an'agonists. this rush, a considerable portion of the wall gave way, and unfortunately its materials furnished the retreating party with the means of renewing the warfare in a mode which most seriously involved the safety all reach of their dangerous missiles. The Blues now retaliated with the same weapons, nvaiiing themselves another brick wall in the neighbourhood of their position for a supply ammunition. length they gained the advantage in this encounter also, and drove the discomfited Grange party before them, not only from the street and the field already mentioned, hut from the nutlets adjoining, and thev now appeared complete masters the field. But it wa3 evident that the ce-sation of hostilities caused this temporary success could not long dura'ion. The Grange forces were again seen mustering immense strength in the distance, and without much delay they presented themselves in huge and threatening mass at the end of Wood-street, filling the area the High-street and Market Place. Some skirmishes took place between detached parties, but speedily the Orange body rushed forward with impetuosity, driving the Blues before them in their turn, and taking possession of-thcir positions. These men, elated by their success, seemed determined to spare neither friend nor foe. Slioweis of stones came incessantly pouring into the hustings, and the situation of all persons there became imminently perilous, the more so as apparent means of escape presented themselves. may he unnecessary to observe tha'. during the whole of the conflict the proceedings of the election were completely suspen led; hot now became evident that it would he necessary terminate them altogether, in mder to avert the most awful consequences, and to put stop to the shedding of human blood. renewed shower of brickbats brought the matter issue. The High Sheriff hastily declared that show hands should be dispensed with, and that poll heirtg demanded on behalf of all the candidates, it should take place Thursday morning. A rapid and general retreat was then commenced from the hustings effect this way was forced into tbe Court House, which thus became intensely thronged the course of a few minutes.

The election of Captain W'eymss has been carried on and gained under the influence of mob intimidation and corruption and now that it has been brought to close, we appeal to our readers in the towns of Falkland, Auchtermuchty, Newburgh, &c, and to all living in their more immediate neighbourho. d, if is not the fact that from the detestation of few petty burgh demagogues and tbe threats of the people, freedom of election has been completely destroyed ? It has been part of the org nised system to call out, upon stated occasions, the bands of music with which so many parts of the country are now infested : excitement by this means has been kept open,\u2014the timid have been overawed,\u2014the wavering concusseed, the profligate, the vain, and the idle have taken the lead, till, marshalled in some under the burgh officials, they \u2022vere drawn like so many slsves on the day of election to the poll. To these deluded selfish men themselves we have much to say. The conduct of some of them during the disgraceful riots at Auchtermuchty on Tuesday last, has been marked, both in cheering on the mob and significantly pointing out the particular electors, as they approached, whom they wished to be insulted. A certain individual, not so wise Hippocrates, and, if we mistake not, in his Majesty'B half-pay, has not escaped observation nor, we trust will he finally elude condign punishment, as he now merits the detestation and abhorence of every lover of peace, order, and good societty. The attack upon D. Maitland Maegill, F.sq., of ltankeilor, than whom better or more upright man does not live, ought to be a warning to them. He too is a Reformer, but because he will not bow to the mob -in all things, nor go all lengths with them, but would be a free man upon occasions, he has fallen under their despotic displeasure. A correspondent says\u2014\"Colonel Lindsay's supporters the Auchtermuchty district, who came forward early on Tuesday morning, got forward to the poll and escaped, comparatively speaking, with little injury, but by ten o'clock the mob had the complete control of the place, and no voter on the Conservative interest could escape. Mr. Tyndal Bruce, Mr. Maitland Macgill, Mr. James Landale, Mr. Niven, Mr. Forester, and others, were all more or less injured, but fortunately lives were lost. It is impossible to describe the fury of the people. Mr. Niven, a tenant of Ford Mansfield, and a man, I suppose, sixty, was tossed and cuffed about until he was all but murdered, his clothes and shirt torn in pieces, and nothing left on him, I am told, but his stockings; and in this plight he was rescued by the constables and pushed into a house, from which he escaped by a back window. Others had their coats torn off their backs, besides being pelted with stones. Mr. Pratt, of Glentarkie, was severely struck under the eye with a stone; the wound bled so profusely as to sicken him, and he was obliged to be put to bed. Mr. Landale's head was cut with a stone, although protected both by his crape and his hat. The Sheriff Mr. Clephane, who, with all the constabulary force, could scarcely be protected to the inn, was pelted and struck with a stone behind the ear. Several voters came to town during the day, and prudently went off; amongst others General Balfour. The General returned next day, expecting the town to be quiet, and after voting, he with difficulty got to neighbouring house, where he was kept prisoner for hours, and escaped at last under the protection of some of the captain's party. Miss Balfour's porter appeared a little after the General, under the colours of Captain YVeymss, and after voting for him was received with cheers !

The particulars, as disclosed in evidence, were these :\u2014About five o\u2019clock the evening of Saturday the 17th tilt., (it being the fair day of Ballibav,) two young men, entertaining sentiments favorable to Mr. Lucas (one of the late Candidates for the representation of the County,) were attending an exhibition in ati itinerant show-box, which was stationed near the cow-fair green, at the northern extremity of the town, when a shout was raised for \u201cWestcnra\u201d (the successful Candidate,} by some persons holding opposite opinions. This shout was promptly replied to those young men, who cried out, Lucas for ever.\u201d A scuffle ensued, in which the two young men were worsted, and obliged to retreat towards the |\u00bbound, situated on the Monaghan-road; here their friends, informed the disaster, rallied to their assistance, and chased their assailants towards the southern extremity of the town, far as Corrybrannoiv bridge; where, on the other band, the Westenra party mustered to the number of 100 and upwards, rallied, and beat back the Lucas party.

Lord Morpeth then came forward, and was received with loud applause his friends, and with disapprobation by the blues. In the course of his address he said\u2014When my hon. opponent talks in his address of resisting the introduction of the Poor-laws into the West Riding .Mr. Wort ley\u2014Those words are not in address, and I should feci sorry to have supposed that I could use any words which could construed to the meaning that I wished promote violent resistance to the law of the huid. At this moment a most tenific conflict commenced between the two rival parties, the blues and the yellows, the former espousing the cause of Mr. Wortley, and the latter that Morpeth and Sir O. Strickland, but so were the combatants mixed, and sudden was the affray, that it waa impossible, beholding from the hustings, to say which parly were the aggressors. The contest was commenced, and continued fur a considerable interval with slight sticks, with which the combatants appeared to have been casually provided, rather than deliberately armed for any purpose of premeditated hostility, but the contest soon assumed fiercer and more sanguinary character; thick branches trees, well the poles of the colours and banners, which were mutually wrested by the one party from the other, serving more efficacious and deadly instruments for the gratification of their reciprocal animosity. In many places might be seen individuals whose condition afforded indisputable proof of the savage determination of the contending factions. Heads laid open and faces disfigured with blood met the eye in every direction. The blue party having been driren up an adjoining lane, appeared to have taken the opportunity of their temporary dispersion to arm themselves with tremendous bludgeons, and having formed themselves in order, again charged upon the Otange party, and although unquestionably very much inferior in point of numbers, completely routed them. Along one side of Wood Street, where the hustings were erected, runs a parapet wall brick-work, separating the street from an adjoining field, about eight or ten feet lower than the ground, which had, till the movement wc are describing, contained several thousands of the Orange party. Many thousands of the same party were also engaged in the dreadful conflict which was going on in the street; these latter when overpowered by their opponents, rushed tumultuously and precipitately across wall into the field below. men and women were seen hurl themselves from the parapet desperately, regardless of the dangerous depth below, and many evidently suffered severely from the wounds inflicted by their indiicriroinating and merciless antagonists. In this rush, a considerable portion of the wall gave way, and unfortunately its materials furnished the retreating party with the means of renewing the warfare in a mode which most seriously involved the safety all within reach of their dangerous missiles. The Blues now retaliated with the same weapons, availing themselves of another brick wall In the neighbourhood of their position for supply ammunition. At length they gained the advantage in this encounter also, and drove the discomfited Orange parly before them, not only from the street and the field already mentioned, but also from the outlets adjoining, and they now appeared complete masters of the field. Bat it was evident that the cessation of hostilities caused by this temporary success could not of long duration. The Orange forces were again seen mustering in immense strength in the distance, and without much delay tlicy presented themselves in huge and threatening mass the end of Wood Street, tilling the ares of the High Street and Market Place. Some skirmishes took place between detached parties, but speedily the Orange body rushed forward with overwhelming impetuosity, driving the Blues before them in their turn, and taking possession of their positions. These men, elateJ by their success, seemed determined to spare neither friend nor foe. Showers of stones came incessantly pouring into the hustings, and the situation of all persons there became imminently perilous, the more no apparent means of escape presented themselves. It may be unnecessary to observe that during the whole of the conHiet the proceedings of the election were completely snfiended but it now became evident that It would necessary to terminate them altogether, in order to avert the most awful consequences, and to put a stop to the shedding of human blood. A renewed ahower of brkkbalt brought the matter to an Issue. The High Sheriff hastily declared that show hands should be dispensed with, and that poll being demanded on behalf of all the candidates, it should take place on Thors- day morning. A rapid and general retreat waa then commenccd from the hustings. To effect this way waa forced into the Court House, which thus became intensely thronged in the course of few minutes. Into an adjoining clumber many wounded persons were conveyed, and the gashes which they had received were temporarily dressed. MEMBERS RETURNED. (Continued from Supplement. ] Aberdeen. \u2014A.

Charles John Brandling, Esq., a magistrate, was next ox- amiucil, and stated that at the time Lord Mlorpeth was speakiiig he observed a great pressure against the iron railing in liront of' the hustings, which soon after gave way, and lie thought at the moment that severi'a persons most have been seveirely iiijured by it ;soon after this lie sawv a band of yellows cooling up Wood-street, four a breast ; wlien they got up to the blues the band halted, uiid thle persons with it forced their way amongst the blues, flourishing- their sticks above their heads, anid ?? the cards out of the hats of the blues -,several of the yellows then struck tile blues some apparently violent blows with thieii' sticks, and the latter retreated ; there were at this time two or three, other Isarties in the crowd fighting with their fists and sticks also. Witness called to them to keep quiet; soon after he saw the blue party come forw'ard w'ithi sticks. The fighitbei'amtne gelieral, and blows wae -stiuckon both sides. He dhirectedl the (constables to go forward, and a portion of them did so ;the yellows had retreated, and in conjuiiction with another magistrate (MNr. Cary) lie got between thle two parties, and saw stoiles, aiid brickbats flying in every (lirectioll from one party to the other ; at this time the two par-ties were about fifty yards asuiider, and, standing betwveei them, he eleh up his hands and called to both pai'ties for God's sake to desist, or lives wvould be lost, and that lie mast read the Riot Act dii'ectly; the tbrowing of stones then ceased on the blue side, as far as lie could obseive ; at this time he had seen tfight 0o' nine people lying on the ground much hurt, and somne of them bleediiig p;rofusely ; one was semiseless and was supported by somle per. sons who were. tr~ lg to assist him ; anothei' was groaning heavib', and blood was streaming from his ]bead ; lie did not know any of themi, hiideed lie had no time to look at them ; lie held up his little book, which coiitained the Riot Amt, and called out, 11Desist, desist, desist I\" as lie walked down the street ; lie was stimick by stones oii the hipl aimd onl the leg ; when hie got within ten or fifteen yards of the yellowv party hie stopped; and begail to read the Riot Act, wheii they gave at loud yell, and brickbits commenced flying again ; one struck him a severe 1)1ow ohl the breast and took lisi breath away, and lie fell back into the armis o1' one of thle special constables ; it was somie minutes before he could speak again, when lie finished thle Riot Act, and concluded by saying \" God save the Queen!'' as loud as lie could. Mkr. W~oitley as;ked him ?? liiisconstables, aiid lie said lie could not tell, for they had all been dispersed; some said, \"Send for the military,'' aiid perceiving that the riot was fast iiicreasing, cud that windows were bicaking in every direc- tion, lie went to the Stafford Ai'ias, anid seiit anl epress to Dewsbury for the military; onl subseqjueiitly hiearing that the military were in Leeds, and iiot Dewsbury, lie sent another ex- pr'ess there; lie tieii went into Wood-street, and found the parties fighting as much. as ever, though now they were skir- mishing, beimig no longer in a solid body lie called out to them t be quiet, as the midtary had bean semat for, land would be there very soon ; he afterwirds i'ode to meet thle military, and told Captain Rose, the commander of thle troops, that tile town was in possession of the mob, and that lie had vead the Riot Act onl arriving in towii they found that thle riot had ceased, and thle military w~ei'e sent into billets; lie sawv a niaii of the name otf Wainwright near the police-oflice before lie left the town, and this Waniiwright hooted aiid halloated the inob at him; lie had him takeii into custody, and wvas then informed that lie had been very active in the riot ;lie found that lie was subsequently released by another Magistrate, at which M~r. Can' aiid ?? were very much surprised, and that lie was acting iii the capiacity of a special coiistable. John Francis Carn', Esq., a magistrate, corioborated the evi- deuce oh' Alr. Birandliiig. Mr. John Barn, chief constablas of Wakefield, also deposed to siuiilar facets. T1he Ilonourable James S. Wortley was then examined, and gave a description of the occurences similar to that which lied been given by the previous witnesses ; lie had beau very active in enideavouiring to quell the riot, and haod been several times struck by stoiies amid other missiles ; lie could nut recogniiieanay one engaged in thle fray ; at ?? period lie thought lisa life was in danger, and flung hack a brick wvhich had previously, knocked a nian down iiear him ; \"lien lie filung it back, it struck no oiie, hut it had tle, effect o f deterri'ing thle niob from followiiig him tt liougli the iron railing. Mi'. Nicholls Brlown, jun., gave evidence to the same effect as the preceding witnesses. Several other witniesses w'eie examined, anid the proceedimigs were coiitiiiued umitil half past eight o'clock at iiight ; but uraisiig the whole of this period we could miot fiiid one tittle of evidenice relating to the death of the unfortunate deceased. The jury comphaiiied, anld With great i'eason, that at the close of the day th ey were as wvise as falien thate' began. In fact one would imagine that the coui't was one of imiruiry iiito the causes of thle disturbance, rather than anl inquest' upoii the body of Mir. Carter. The inquest stands at present adjourned until to-morrow. WAKErFiLD AuGUST P.-TNr. Tlionas Haley deposed that onl the day of nomination lie saw stones flung by both blues and yellows, aiid sawv the latter di'ive thle forinei' ofh'the gi'ouiid. Mu'r. Carter, the deceased, was one of the last blues lie saw'. lie did not see him till lie was kiiockcd dowyn, about the third w'indowv from Wood-street, w~ith a boulder or a stone. Wit- ness dlid not see it throwim. Ilis hat witls kiiocked off. A man struck limn with a blue stafi' on lisi bare head. Tilie blood tlowed fast froni his face and head after the blow', Ilie thought lie wvas stooping to prick up his hat at the tiuie lie was struck. Thle deceased tried to get auvay towauds Wood-street, and laid hold of the rails, when lie reeled twice rouiid. When lie got to the lamp-post, at the isorth-east corner of the palisiades, he fell. A iwaui in y'ellow colourms w'as standing oiveir limo, as wit- uiess thought to piotect him. At that nioiienit witniess was sti'uck on the throat with a brick, aiid saw' the deceased iio iaoie. lie did not sea any stick in 'Mr. Carter's hand. Never heard hiin speak. Mlr. Carter %was thou removed. Mrs. Shiaw' deposed that she resided near tlheSessions-liouse, and smw the (listurbauices frm'i her gai'deii. Saw the deceased two or three tinies stiuck with a staff mnade of a blue pole, shat- tered at thie end. Saw him fall twice. Thle first blow knocked his halt off. Aftei' his first fall lie appeared as if' lie got several blows before lie got lip. Witness felt quite sick. Was sore they would kill him1, anod she ian awvay. Ilae was struck onl tha right siue of the head by the blue pole. Five or six individuals struck him, and witness called them fiends. The Rev. W. T. Alderson, chaplain of thle House of Correc- tion at Wakefield, deposed thiat lie was standinug near' the iron gate of thle Court-house when lie saw the mleceasedl knocked dlowmi, and on his rising knocked dow'n again. The deceased wvas thle only nie of the lue party at that timne on the spot. Mr. E . Halliday, of Leeds, mannufacturer-, deposed thatr lie was urncle to the deceased, aiid onl the Dew'sbury'-road while riding in ain open carriage withi sonic fr~iendls, oil 'the eveniiig of thle 31st of J'ily, a mob of yellows with a green flag paissed him, amid called out, \"D-n thee, we have neai'hy killed thy brothier~in-law', and I am only surly we have not done for ?? lie did not know any of tieni. They wvere working men. leiiry Dunn, surgeon, described the symptomis w'lici Ilie had ob~served wvien callied iii to the deceased. h)eatli wlls caused by the effusion of blood onl the br'aill, occasiomied by the blow' on thie si~le of the beadl. Mr. l)aiwlon, surgeon, com'ioborateil Mr. Dunmi. Mir. Hleininway gave ?? evidence. This being the last witness called by the solicitor couuducting the proceedlings on the pait of thle friends of Mr'. Caiter, r.lkiii, solicitor to the committee for conductingLi' Morpetih'sandi Sir G. Strickland's electiomi, aiddressed time Coi'o- user, and saidh that from the torn the investigatioa had taken, tendimig, its it did, to cast limiputation umion their party, lie felt it necessary to call evidence to give a different colouriiig to the commiencement of the riot. The Coroner said they Sevre there to inquire into the death of mIr. Carter, an(i too Inuch of their time had been wasted the previcus day upon testimony which was not relevant to the inquiry. He was AtMil b)und to hear any evidence that miight be offered touching the death of the deceased, but lie could not hear any further evidence as to the cause of the riot. Mr. Ikin said that it was because irrelevant evidence had been received, involving his party in blame, that lie nowv called for the reception of evidence to show they were not the ag- gressors. The Coroner said he should decline receiving any further evi- dence which didl not immediately relate to the death of the de. ceased, and charged the Jury. The Jury, after half an hour's deliberation, returned a verdict of Manslaughter against some person or persons unknown.\" ", "word": "2330", "description": "... commander of thle troops, that tile town was in possession of the mob, and that lie had vead the Riot Act onl arriving in towii they found that thle riot had ceased, and thle military w~ei'e sent into billets; lie sawv a niaii of the name otf Wainwright ...", "keyword": "Election Riot", "hint": "ELECTION RIOT AT WAKEFIELD.\u2014INQUEST ON THE BODY OF MR.

{"ocr": "- -1 - -- -- - -- : , - COUNTY OF AYn ELECTION AND RIOT. -t AH A fnr th. cn-mtv of Avtr took pIaM. The election of a representative for the county of Ayr took pla c olt Wednesday, and having terminated in favour of the urnpopular caandidate, Colonel Blair of Blair, who was chosen in opposition tec It. A. OslvaC., Esq. of Auchincruive, by a majority of P3 to i6, was followed 1e the most disgraceful ebullition of popular fury. Previous to the dany of Clccioesll. the Sheriff issued a proclamation, warning the people oghitot comrici to .iyf inrbodles, as such a proceeding would \" greatly hazard, it' eot gctutly amount to a breach of tlie peace, in as nmucje as it would have tisc I Mktg'f ance, and might be construed into the direct lsftlntion, oef contrel3ng shei freedom of voting in those to 'whom the elective franchise Ie: con'i dd Dy law-an act highly illegal and unconstitutional.\" Early in the nisornoseg of ithe election, also two troops of the 4th Irish Dragool Guards wvore march- ell into the barracks and the gates locked. As soon as the election was over, which wis frequently iiterrupted by noise and uproar, Colonel Blair's voters attempted to ge't out ai the back I oor, but discovereil that the Court House was completely surcuemleed by a most determined mob, whose threats and menaces clearlv sheowed that their only refuge was to remain where they were. After res rainung n-early three hours closely confined, in vain expectation that the mol) iwvo ui dis- perse, durieg which time some of the windows of 'the (feurt I1vu e were broken by volleys of stosses, one or two of them attempted Ws Getas.* y ain- der escort of MIr Oswald, the popular canslidsate, and thei !'rc,,est {if Ayr, but stones were nevertheless thrown at both panties. At length 3 signal was gin en for the Dragoons to advance, and all parties being ag, reed on tihe per. frct necessity of the measure, the Riot Act was read. The :-ilitary were not long in making their appearance, but the multitude shrwed no dispo. sition whatever to retire; many stones were thrown, and a vioesit and dalngerotts uproar ensued. Some of the rioters received slops with the broad sides of the swords, and one fellow who had bemn sonu throwing a stone was chased up the steps of the county buildings by the soldior lie in- suIted, who, fortunately, refrained from doing more than giving him two or three heavy strokes, A party of tie Dragoons weree them formed Into a circle for the purpose of receiving Colonel Blair and his friends inside, In order to convey them oit board the Largs steamer, which wts lying at thcct Qucay to receive them. The scene that occurred after the cavalcade got near ,he vessel was dreadfsl; easdid most wonderful it is that no onel wad killed on the spot. The stones weere thrown ice showers, pyincitsslly by a nmultitude who lad assembled on en eminence, where they were Well ,0l1- plied with these missiles, acid from which, although dislodgedc by the .n- eltry more thaic once, With mutual wounds, they as often rcturned ou the combat. The moment the cavalry got the gentlceoet on board tile steam-boat, they left them, when the deck was completely swept with showess of stones. The whole of the party, and every soeul so leck, rain below,, save ther poor fellow at the helin, wvho was most shaccsefully paelted uetil he got the cable cut on board, no one daring to unloose the rope on I shore for fear of the mob. They then got to sea, but so sicterrained were Fthe rurihans on the destruction of Colonel Blair that it was sail they as- tsembled at many places along the coast where it was thought most probable lie would attesupt a aicetling. On the return of the military fronm this piece of service, some of them appeared to have sustained consilerable injury. The Lord Justice Clerk, and his son, and other two gentleeien raso still remained in duerance escaped by a mianamcvre from the fiery of thse nsob, protected by teos or tvelve dragoois ; bcit It eras necessary again for the dragoons, onl retiring to the barracks, to dlheel round anid charge on the .mob, winsie conetinued to assail them with showers of stories. No lives, however, were lost; aciI o0l the retiring of the military the snob dispersed after wreakicg their vengeance oil the windows acid hocusis cef several geetlemees who had voted for Colonel Blair. The mob 'ngaged ice tbseo pro ceedings were the most sanguiiary ever witnessed. Nothing it rppear- ed couldl have yielded them half so mnuch pleasureras to have trainpled Over ithe sead body of Colonel Blair. Wr Lade of Port Glasgow, one of the voters, died in the sleaso-boat be- ?? Ayr and Ardrossan. He had beon previously in very last health. A gentsesnan who came up in the Largs steamboat deslrribes the dieiner scene as one of the most striking lie ever witnessed. Osee of thie voters vwas Iying a corpse il all adjoising apartineet, while moft cof those who sat i at table had their heads bound up with bloody handkerchief's. Ite says Coloiel Blair sas severely cut o05 tlh back part of lis ieadt. Ilis tat bore the essiarks of many blows. L Demitrswetonshisrc.-The election of a member of Parllamret for this couety took place on Tuesday, when Lord M. W. Grcasain seas returned by a sceajority of F. Tlce number of freeholders who voted for his Lord- ship was 2ti, for Mr Colqeluii, 23.

Harrison Vallop said he had the honour of nominating Richard llunbury Gurney, highly respectable individual, as a fit and proper person to serve in Parliament. ( Immense cheering.) Anthony Esq. seconded the nomination; and said that Sir. Gurney was their loag-tried and valued representative. They had ever found him faithful in the discharge of his duties, and true friend their best interests\u2014as such, he confidently hoped the electors would their duty by again returning him their member. {Applause.)

Since that article was written, fresh and repealed instances have come to our tars of the use to which gold has been successfully employed in the pollution of poor men to abandon their principles, and vote against their consciences, in support the old Tory system. The returns upon the canvass were, as know from the best authority, a majority considerably more than in favour of Gurney and Ker. know, too, that very great number poor electors, when called upon to fulfil their promises, replitd that they were offe.ed a-piece t\u00bb vote for Stormont and Scarlett, and that they should vote unless they had a higher bid. know, to the grea.t disgrace many of the new \u00a3lO. electors\u2014to the disgrace tb \u00bbsc who have just come into the enjoyment their franchise, and ish be regarded standing in a decent station society, that many of these have thus sold their votes, and wallowed in corruption. know that, at the moment we are writing, a list of more than names are ticked off, as having thus forfeited their pledges. know, too, that it is in contemplation publish the names those defaulters from honest principle, who, bribe, threat, or proiuie, have thus degraded them-elves. The polling went on very ablv, both booths, till about two o\u2019clock. At the blue and white booth a very slack fire was kept up; and saw but little of long processions, with flags, and banners, and music, from the different club houses, which have been accustomed to sec similar occasions. Dec .\u2022nt people, either side, were promiscuous y meeting either b oth till two o\u2019clock, without l.ie slightest ins ilt interruption. At about one, Messrs.

The rank Lord Stormont gave him \u2018priority in the procession, lie had passed very quietly beside the chain which divides the market, fur tiie purpose keeping asunder the opposite parties, without any other annoyance than that the cheering of his own friends was responded to the hooting of his opponents. There was appearance even of a disposition to personal confl.ct. The chair of Sir James Scarlett followed the chair of Lord Stormont, the distance ncrlmpt of or yards; and very respectable gentleman, whose name we can bring forward, it necessary, assured us that the tow who \u00bbw took place arose f.om one Sir J.

The friends and admirers of Mr. Arthur Blenuerhassett, the late, and it is to be hoped, the future, member for Kerry county, entertained that gentleman at a public dinner in Tralee Saturday last. Mr. Blennerhaseett\u2019s health being proposed, in returning thanks thus referred to the reoent contest :\u2014 Gentlemen,\u201d said Mr. Blennerfaassett, tf it is proud consolation to me to think that, though 1 no longer enjoy the honourable privilege of representing my native county in Parbament, the friends who stood around In the hour of trial\u2014an ordeal, indeed, to try men\u2019s souls \u2014still possess the confidence in me which first led them to vindicate in person the independence of this great county. (Loud and continued cheers.) Gentlemen, it is true have been defeated in our efforts to follow up the glorious victory of 1837, when the gentlemen of Kerry and hernonest farmers united to send me to Parliament. But, gentlemen, have been defeated by violence\u2014by unfair, unmanly, and dishonourable conduct, through base and corrupt agencies. (Hear,hear.)\u201d Mr. Serjeant Jackson, too, who was one of the invited guests, thus touched on the same theme: You have (said learned Serjeant) been borne down by means which, you were yourselves above the degradation of adopting such means, yon were unprepared for, and thus you have been deprived of the services of my hon. friend. Nor is yours solitary case. (Hear, hear.) It is not in the county of Kerry alone that voters hare been interrupted when coming to the poll, kidnapped, and prevented from using the elective franchise. In numbers of other counties, wnere it was known that the same species of violence and intimidation could be resorted to with effect, I solemnly believe by virtue of an organization, a determined plan, the same engines were brought to bear with you, ana with the same success. I allude particularly to the county of Cork, with which I am more immediately connected, the city of Cork, Tipperary, Clare, and I might allude to Carlow. In all those places where this species of violence could be resorted to with success it was unscrupulously adopted. Gentlemen, it is a matter of great importance that the true state of this country should be made known to the Imperial Parliament. It is fit and proper that our Parliamentary friends in England, and our friends in general in the sister country, should know under what circumstance* the Conservatives are placed in the southern counties of Ireland with reference to tne elective franchise. If such state of things that which has prevailed latterly were permitted to continue the elective franchise would be nothing more, would be worse than mockery ; for it is not the electors of the counties or of the cities that will return members to Parliament, but the non-electors\u2014those would be the persons to return the men who were to represent the sense of the Commons of these realms. Therefore, if you will excuse a stranger, I will take the liberty of impressing on your minds propriety, nay, the necessity, which exists for your stating, in petition to the Commons\u2019 House of Parliament, the actual state of things which obtained during the late election, putting forward the simple plain facts of the case, such you can amply substantiate by evidence. The same ought to be done by every other connty, city, and borough where similar means have been resorted to, so that the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland shall know how elections are carried on in considerable portion of the southern part Ireland.\u201d At the Cork county assizes on Saturday last Owen Connor was found guilty of a riot and assault on the police on the 7th of July at Rinsale.

The Derry Journal, Whig Government paper, with a candour which might be creditably imitated by its me\u2018ropolitan contemporaries professing similar politics, thus remarks on the recent Riband convictions at the Tyrone assizes\u201c It will be observed, from the report of those assizes, that, notwithstanding the praiseworthy exertions of the Irish Executive and its officers, they have succeeded only in scotching the snake of Ribandism, without actually killing it, and that it still continues to poison, with its pestilential breath, some of the lower orders of society. The informer upon the trial which took place at Omagh appears to have been a despicable and depraved person but it is just persons of his stamp with whom Ribandmen must associate, and it is by their agency that the hidden deeds of the conspirators must, of necessity, be brought to light. are bound to state our perfect conviction that the testimony of that man was so amply corroborated as to leave no doubt of the guilt of the prisoners. They appear, on unquestionable evidence, to have been men of good and honest which may entitle them to the merciful consideration of the Government; but an admixture of such men in criminal conspiracy detracts nothing from its guilt, but adds greatly to its danger. In the course of his address to the jury, Mr. Schoales, Queen\u2019s Counsel, made some startling observations, which, have no doubt, will rivet the attention of the public, and probably lead to a Parliamentary inquiry.\u201d There wm splendid review and field-day of all the troops in garrison in the Phoenix-park this afternoon, given for the entertainment of the officers and men of Her Majesty\u2019s ship Belleiale, now lying in Kingstown harbour.

Long before court hour (so our informant proceeds,\" there was unusual stir in the streets, owing to the arrival of great number of parsons and strange magistrates, and people wondered, indeed, what could bring together so many, until it was made known that some election quarrels, provoked the hired bullies of the Orangemen, were to be disposed of at petty sessions, and it was concluded, of course, that those gentry assembled for the purpose vindicating the law, tusk to which the magistrates usually presiding were deemed unequal.\u2014 No doubt the magistrates of the Cashel district are active, intelligent, upright men, and all ordinary cases of crime their judgment may trusted, is ; but when an election riot is to be scrutinised, the . magistrates who live at a distance very properly volunteer their assistance.

Rockwell; Capt Long, Longfield ; Mr. Clarke, Holycross; and William Cooper, Esq. There were also sitting the bench [not magistrates] the Rev. Mr. Phillips, Herbert MandeviUe, and two three others. The first decision of this formidable bench was, that a man who was called bastard during election riot, was perfectly justified in striking the per son who called him so, and splitting his lip. The man was Price, runner to Mr. Phelan, the Attorney. The evidence was clear against him\u2014nay, the fact was admitted that he struck the man with won key and split his upper lip ; and because was called a bastard the decision of the Bench was, tnat he was -perfectly j.cstificd\u201d The same Price admitted, on his oath, that fired a loaded pistol among a large crat'd, and the Bench took no notice whatever of the fact. _ In another case, where Sarah Price was plaintiff and defendant, a little girl was convicted of spitting in her face and calling her certain vile names, which Surah was too modest to explain, and bound over to stand her trial at the Clonmel Quarter Sessions ; and the same Sarah was also convicted, and similarly bound over, for throwing boiling water at the girl and burning her neck with it.

Being doubtful as to its genuineness, he, w th the knowledge of the prisoner, sent his apprentice with it ;o the Bank, where it was recommended that the party shouli give his address, as they could not vouch for its being good ore. On being requested to write his name and residence, he wrota on it, Thomas Jeller (or some similarly sounding name) of Driby.\u2014ln a day or two the note was discoverer! to forged, and 4r. Sutton went to Driby, but could not hear of any person of that name. Recollecting that the man's nails had tokens of shoemak ir\u2019s wax on them, he made enquiries which led him to Swab?, the adjoining village to Driby, where with the help of a eon table he took the prisoner Rowsfon in his house.

Mr. Sutton, however, stated that he distinctly said to the prisoner at the time when I e put the pen before him, write name Edward Graves, who had pleaded guilty to a similar indictment in the morning, was called as a witness for the prosecution. He gave a mi lute description of the trading in forged notes in that part of t he county, which, if he can be believed, must have been carri on to a fearful extent at Lincoln, Louth, Alford, and several other places.\u2014Verdict, guitty.\u2014 Sentence, to be or life, and the same sentence waa passed on Graves. I'riday. Charge of Em bezzlement at Louth. George Tc'Xworth, aged 33, was charged with embezzling certain sums received by him as manager of a nuraery ground for the late W. Wilson, Esq., sol citor, of Louth. The nursery had once been the property of t ie prisoner's father, and came into Mr. Wilson\u2019s possession a ecurity (an insufficient one, accord, i tc the statement of Mr. Wilson\u2019s clerk), for sums of money due to Mr. Wilson. The cor cern continued to be carried on in the name of Tux worth, thr prisoner, and his brother. The brother absconded early in 1329, and the prisoner, at his own earnest solicitation, was made manager of the concern, a salary of per week and a house ant free. His instructions were render weekly accounts of all sales of produce, Ac., well as payment of all monies receive I.\u2014lt was remarked upon the prosecutor\u2019s case, the Judge, that the evidence was incomplete, inasmuch the memoranda had not been produced which the prisoner used to give in to I is employers, stating the various sums which he had received. The Jury could not certain that the very sums specified in th indictments had not been stated by the prisoner these mem tranda as having been received by him ; in which case his holdii ig them hack would be matter of debt and not of embezzlement Upon this objection verdict of nut guilty was consented to, a id the other indictments, resting on the same evidence, were withdrawn.\u2014One case, not liable to this objection, was entered int), which Tuxworth was charged with receiving the amount of an account due from Mr. Richard Ellison, \u2018\u2018with intent to delraud the said Richard Ellison.\u201d Upon this indictment Mr. Justice Park observed that Mr. Ellison could not the party whom t le prisoner was seeking to defraud, for Mr. Ellison could not be tailed upon second time for the money : the prisoner having teen put forth to the world by the proprietors if he were hin self the real party in the concern, his receipt to Mr. Ellison wa a sufficient discharge. This indictment also was therefore abandoned, & the prisoner discharged. Charge of stealin i a Skin at Grimsby. Thomas Storr, aged 40, feilmonger, of Great Grimsby, was charged with stealing a gre; mare\u2019s skin, belonging to Mr. Patchett, farmer, of Swinhop The skin was taken by the pri. \u2019s son, to Mr. Little, le.ither-dresser, for sale, who gave him 9*. for it. The prisoner\u2019s defence was, that it was brought to him by a person professing to come from Binbrook, to sell it and a shcep->kin for his maste . Kirk, neighbour of the prisoner, confirmed the statem nt of such a person\u2019s having come wilh two skins for sale. The risoner was acquitted, and told the Judge that he left the court without a stain upon his character. Boston Ei ection Riots. Frederick Moellr alias Jiller, Robert Shoit, Daniel Hates. Thomas Glew, Thomas Waite, John Wells, Edwd. Gotloe Clement, and Willi Bradshaw, were arraigned on a charge of noting at Boston. The indictment stated that the defendants with others, to the lumber of 500 and more, riotously assembled on the 13th of May 1 1st for the purpose of resisting the apprehension of Henry Maddis an Mowbray, charged with assault upon Wi'liam Joyes, one of the constables of the borough, and also to resist the apprehension of Thomas Box and James Box, charged with assault. The prisoner Moeler a Swiss, and lost one of his arms in a nava engagement: he was dressed for the occasion in av. hile waistec at with blue buttons. Bradshaw, when arraigned, flourished his hand, and shouted not guilty. All the others pleaded the sail e.\u2014ln summing up the evidence. Sir James Parke said the question was whether the Jury were satisfies) that all these persons, nr some of them, were concerned the ofience. That there i riot on the day referred to was beyond a doubt, and whether it was or was not an election riot made no difference- God forbid that party spirit should ever have place in a court of justi :e. The Jury, after a short hesi. tation, returned a verdict of gt \u00abf/y against all the prisoners except Bradshaw.--Moeler was sentenced to be Imprisoned for 18 months, Shout for 12 months Waite, Woods, and Bradshaw, each for nine months, and Wells, Glew, Clement, and Hayes for six months each, to hard labot in Spalding house of correction, and to find sureties to keep the peace.\u2014They were lodged in pri. son at Spalding on Monday morning, Wm. Woods and Wm Bradshaw were next put on trial, changed with breaking the windowsof Mr. Thos. Broughton, brewer, in Boston, on the 27th of April last Mr. Clinton conducted this and the other Aon proeecotions for election riots. Mr. Amos, for the defence, addressing the Jury, said, am happy, Gentlemen, that at las there is no difference of opinion between me and Mr. Clinton o this being an election riot. You have been witness to-day of a ost peculiar event in the history of the literature and language of o ir country ; you have been favored with a lecture upon popular tights and public elections by my learned friend, the member for he rotten borough of Aldborough. (Laughter.) What does he ki about popular rights; he goes down to his borough in a snug post chaise, and returns again in live minutes a new-made and it imaculate member parliament. (Kenewed laughter.) His Lilliautian mind cannot conceive any thing of public rights; such flings are never heard of in his borough. Mr. Broughton\u2019s dimer party was far more numerous than Mr. Clinton\u2019s constitiienti. (Laughter ) But, Gentlemen, be serious, must complain of learned friend for inflaming your minds. It seems that Mr Broughton\u2019s house was the ren. dezvous fur the pride of the Pi ik party. There was one lady to grace the board. Surely there a sufficient number gentlemen to protect her ; hut frit nd talks of violence being offered to private dwellings, and the v olation of females! That is the kind of inflammatory language--the incendiarism, he thinks pro. per use to set your minds on ire. Gentlemen, I call him the Boston Guy Faux (loud laughter), and the Mayor and Corporation of Boston are the Pope ant Cardinals ; and I should not be surprised if his effigy is chaired through Boston streets, with his own inflammatory brief in his ha id, instead ofa bunch of matches, and the little boys will shout A stick and si ake For King Willlar t's sake, Pray remember p >or Guy Clinton.\" (Bursts of laughter from all rts of the Court, in which the Judge and Mr. Clinton good-naturedly joined.) The Jury returned a verdict guilty against both the defendants Several persons gave the good characters.\u2014They were sentenced each to be imprisoned in Spalding house of correction for nine months and kept to hard labour; and the expiration of that period give securities to keep the peace for two years, themselves in 100/, each and two sureties each in 10/. The judge remarked, I hope this will be I he means of a contested election hereafter at Boston being icted in more quiet manner.

{"ocr": "UPPER CANADA MONTREAL, Jive 16. That dreadful disease, the cholera, introduced by the Irish settlers, broke out here three days after its appearance at Quebec, and, for the extent of the population, has been a3 mischievous as in France. Last night's Report of our Me- dical Board was 230 deaths and 1,204 cases! It is said to have abated a little; but there are cases in all parls of the town, and among all classes, though the Irish emigrants and the poor Canadians are the principal sufferers. All business is stopped . The Americans and Upper Canada people have all left us, and the country-people will not come near us. Many of our own townsfolk have also deserted us. It has been ap- palling to see the dead Iwdies carting through the streets with no attendants but the driver, who pitches them into large holes, and goes back for a fresh load. No bells are tolled, and no bodies allowed to be taken to the churches. One medical Gentleman has just told me that he thinks the disease is at a pause, but that the cases are very severe. They have extended to La Prarie, Longueil, and Chambly; that is, along the line of settlers making for the States ; and our distress is increased by the emigrants being sent on to us from Quebec, where they become a burden to us, as the boat- men Kill not any longer take them on to Upper Canada ; in short, nobody will work, and fear and dismay are depicted in almost every countenance. If it stop emigration the radicals of this province will have one comfort from it. In regard to myself and family, we must take our chance in town, as we are better lodged, and can get medical assist- ance. My only precaution is to avoid the infected, and pre- vent settlers, beggars, and others from coming on my premises. / have not a doubt of its being infectious, as it has come to this place from Quebec without infecting any part of the country where the steam-boats did not stop; and those persons have been infected who have had communication with tlie sick, Doctors Robertson and Caldwell aud their Ladies, and some passengers in steam- boats. It vvill cause great alarm in the United States, as it was not expected to attack them from this quarter. The season here is rather backward, but looks well. Arrangements are making to establish a Paper in French, to be called L' Ami dv Peuple, to counteract the mischievous, treasonable, and libellous Papers that circulate here. We may have some hope from the dissemination of truth among the French party in their own language. P.S. 17th. \u2014 I regret to say that the cholera continues very severe. There must have been upwards of one hundred deaths in the last twenty -four hours. I find that it is ex- tending round the town. About sixteen soldiers died, but the cases in the regiment are diminishing. At Quebec the deaths are less numerous than with us, and it is thought that the virulence of the disease has abated there. The markets are ill-supplied through fear among the inha- bitants ; the Priests ana Doctors are almost worn ont. The leading articles ofthe Minerve and I indicator for months past have been written with a view to make thp Cana- dians look on emigration with abhorrence, and persuade them that they will be deprived of their lands, and become the nig- gers or slaves of the English. The agitators are getting up meetings for the ostensible purpose of petitioning the Governor to assemble the Legislature, to inquire into the death of the people shot in the election riot, but in reality to prevent the disposal of Crown lands, and defeat the object of the British American Land Company. He cannot but see into their schemes, and refuse it, which if he does, they will soon overhaul his Governorship the first opportunity. The effect of the Company would be most beneficial, par- ticularly in dividing their settlers among the Canadians as much as possible. There will be many townships and seigno- ries for sale, which the Company may find to their interest to purchase. The tenures can be commuted. MONTREAL, June 18. I cannot longer refrain touching on the dreadful scourge that has attacked us. Thank God, all about our establish- ment are yet well ; but for how long? Your friend is writing you in detail. The town is almost deserted. Since this day week, when it broke out, I am within bounds in saying that 500 persons have died here, the deaths not being confined to theemigrants, or lowest class, although principally so. The doctors, among whom your friends Robertson and Caldwell have been extremely active, are beginning to arrive at some success in their practice ; but most of them and their wives have been attacked, more or less, but are recovering. I dare not anticipate the dreadful effects this matter will have on all our business operations; no sales and no payments. Even the steam-boats are stopped running between this and Quebec, the crews having abandoned them ; the same has taken place with those navigating the Upper Canada craft ; many of the boatmen have died. No doubt the disease will extend itself to Upper Canada and the United States. Thank God my dear wife is in spirits, and shows no alarm ; courage proves the greatest preventive. You may have seen that the Tracy party accuse the Hon. Mr. MoFFATand Sami elGerrardol\" attacking a party with stones whilst they sheltered themselves behind the military during the election riot. Mr. Gerr.ard was sitting in his own house at the time, and Mr. Moffatt was in front ofthe troops, endeavouring to disperse the people. The fellows have deposed to this effect. Mr. Gerrard seems to take no no- tice of their lies, but Mr. Moffatt has thought fit to deny the accusation by documents. QUEBEC, June 19. Our friend is recovering; hut every man at our Court is laid up. The number of cases are certainly abating, but the deaths exceed 1,1)00! The Captain ofthe //tbe has been unwell several days ; he must not come on shore. 1 will go on board and see him iv the morning.

{"ocr": "Cross-examined the Attorney-General\u2014 I am editor of the Birmingham Journal, and have been since February 1836. The paper supports the anti-rate party. I am a member of the Political Union. The motion for second chairman was put by Muntz. It was carried by a large majority.\u2014[Judge\u2014l suppose there were a great number there who had no more business there than me\u2014a number of boys, children, and rabble.\u2014Douglas\u2014l do not know, my Lord.] Winfield came down and stood in front the organ passage. Pare said, will you authorise me as your representative to demand a sight of the book ?\u2014[Judge\u2014 After he got his supposed authority he went to the rector \u2014Douglas\u2014Tea, my Lord.] There was a rush, but I did not observe rush from the south gallery. Munti clambered over the pew with his stick in his hand. I was not alarmed for him or any one else. If any of the pews had given way it would not have alarmed me. did not see Rawlins seize the stick, nor any struggling between any one. The confusion had then hardly begun, and from the time Muntz left until he returned to the pew it might be two minutes and a half. As far as I observed there was no attempt to get possession of the book by force. About dozen persons pressed down to the rector's pew. They stood perfectlystill. There were six or seven street-keepers who stood perfectly still. My opinion was, that the interposition of the police would have caused riot. Re-examined by Sergeant Wilde.\u2014When the streetkeepers entered talking was going on, but nothing more. I never saw Muntz attempt to enter the rector's pew. Benjamin Hadley was examined by Sergeant Wilde. I was at the meeting in question. I remember Pare rising from his seat tn advance towards the rector'spew. recollect Mr. Muntz leaving his seat. I quitted the seat after Pare and before Muntz. Pare had arrived at the door the rector's pew, and he was prevented entering. I fancied he was in danger, and I left to assist him. There was some slight annoyance. I saw Muntz in the passage close to the rector's pew where I was. 1 did not hear any conversation between Rawlins and Muntz, except that I said, M you are not Rawlins the constable.\" Muntz said, \" yes, he is.\" He showed me his staff, and then knew he was the constable. I then said, if you be a constable, I put Mr. Pare into your charge, for I know he does not intend to break the peace.\" Rawlins said, I know he does not.\" I then went back to the pew I occupied. Muntz never attempted to get into the rector's pew. After this conversation with Rawlins, lost sight of Muntz, and found him in the pew when returned. I lost sight of Rawlins also. Rawlins looked a little queer, but was not excited. Muntz appeared unusually cheerful, for he laughed at not knowing Rawlins was the constable. I observed violence except the pressure. I saw no blows given by any body. Cross-examined by Mr. Baiguy.\u2014When I lost sight of Rawlins and Muntz after the conversation, lam not sure whether Pare was in the rector's pew or not when I got there. I will swear Pare was pushed violently, but not know by whom. I was about four yards from him. I was not at the extreme end of the pew. I fancied Pare would be molested or injured. I hardly know what I mean hv danger. I am a member of the Political Union, but not secretary. I have been secretary. I seconded the motion that the Rector should be removed from the chair, and Mr. Winfield placed in his stead. Thomas Ham.ey examined hy Sergeant Wilde. am watch-maker in Birmingham, and was at the church on Raster Tuesday. I remember Mr. Muntz leaving his pew. stepped first upon the front of the gallery, and then went to the pew behind the rector. Mr. Knott laid hold of his stick, apparently to take it from Muntz. He afteiwards gave it Douglas on being asked to so. .Mr. Muntz used his stick in other manner than to retain his standing. He never brandished it over his head, but was compelled to hold it above the heads of the people. never attempted to enter the rector's pew. Cross-examined the Attorney-General.\u2014 Mr. Douglas was within half a yard when Mr. Knott seized Muntz's stick. did not see Muntz lay hold of Mr. Rawlins's stick. It was generally known in Birmingham that Mr. Rawlins was constable. John Arnold examined by Mr. Humfrey.\u2014l am an attorney at Birmingham, and vestry clerk to St. Martin's. I was prevented attending illness on Easter Tuesday. The right of voting for several years has been discussed, and was asked for my opinion. My opinion was. that the inhabitant householders were entitled to vote ; and also said that if the meeting were held by ancient usage.

Cross-examined the Attorney-General. \u2014l know <d no peculiar usage in this parish before Sturges Bourne\\ Act. The Rector named one churchwarden and the parishioners the other. was elected vestry clerk twenty years ago, and I have remained so since. My partner was Warwick on the day election. This concluded the evidence for the defence. The Attorney-General in reply.\u2014May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury\u2014lt now becomes duty to address you in reply on the part of the prosecution in this case, and I must bespeak the indulgent hearing my Lotd and you to the observations I shall feel it duty to address you. They shall be, I assure you. life* as possible. I am only anxious fairly to discharge the duty I owe to clients.\" Gentlemen, this has been a very long and very fatiguing case but I am sure that to it's termination you will show that patience and attention which has hitherto characterised your demeanour in that box. Gentlemen, I am sorry to be obliged to begin by remark or two personal to mjself. My conduct counsel for this prosecution has been arraigned. It is always with extreme reluctance that I speak of myse.f, hut I bound, from what is due to my honour and the interests my clients, to explain under what circumstances I appear before you. Geutiemen, in the common discharge of I duty as a Counsel practising in her Majesty's Court Queen's Bench, assisted my learned friend. Sir William Follett, this criminal information. should hare been guilty of a gross dereliction of duty if 1 had not given my best exertions for obtaining this criminal information by all legitimate means. The criminal information being granted, the powerful assistance of my learned friend, Mr. Sergeant Wilde, is called in on the part of the defendants, and certainly they could not have made more discreet choice. I am retained, I allow very unnecessarily, to attend before my Lord and you as counsel for the prosecution. I should have been guilty of a dereliction ol duty, under these circumstances, \"if I had deserted clients who had placed confidence in me; and therefore may say, though far from willingly, I accepted the retainer which I now present myself before you.\u2014Gentlemen, an attack is then made upon the Rector for instituting this prosecution. Was the scene that took place on the \"28th of March, 1837, in St. Mariin's, Birmingham, to piss over like a summer cloud ? Was no notice to be taken it ? Were such scenes to be repeated from year to year, and to spread from Biimingham around the restof the realm 1 submit to you. that it was indispensably necessary that this growing disposition to tumult and disturbance should checked. That upon this occasion, there had been displayed a turbulence\u2014a disregard of the law\u2014a total breach of the rules of decorum and of decency\u2014and disregard of all that ought to keep men within the bounds of moderation in society, which rendered it indispensably necessary that check should given to it, and that a prosecution should he instituted. What course did my client, the Rector, pursue This meeting took lace on the 31st of March a circular is issued among the most influential and respectable inhabitants ofthe parish, that they should meet upon the Monday following\u2014that was the'seventh day alter the time when the disturbance took place\u2014and that they should consider what were the proper steps to be pursued. That meeting did take place, gentlemen, upon Monday the 3d of April; and I was very glad that an interlocutory observation of my friend. Sergeant Wilde, although somewhat irregular on his part, was of great advantage to me ; because it enabled me utterly to dismiss, and to show that there was no foundation whatever for the charge that he made, that this prosecution was instituted to meet action that had been brought against the proprietors of a newspaper. What evidence have you upon that subject ? The meeting was assembled on the 3d of April, this writ was not issued\u2014there is not the slightest evidence that any action was in contemplation, that were aware of, until the .sth of April, say, gentlemen, that there much more reason to suppose that the action was sued out as an answer to the information, than that the information was thought of way of a set-off to the action. And what do know about the action ? Gentlemen, my friend, although he spares no pains make his case good, has not in the slightest degree shown to you how. or against whom a writ was sued out, or for what it was sued out, or that it had any connection whatever with the disturbance which tuok place the 28th of March ; but on the 3d of April a meeting is held, when it was resolved that an application should made to the Court of Queen's Bench. Was there any thing improper in that? Gentlemen. I allow that the Court of Queen's Bench on such subject is to be considered only as grand inquest\u2014as a grand jury\u2014it only says a man is to he put upon his trial ; hut an application to tbe Court Queen's Bench cives the party accused a very great advantage he heard in bis defence before the bill is found. Every thing he can say to purge and to implicate the accuser is suggested\u2014and it is not until both sides have been heard that the prosecution decided upon ; and therefore these defendants were more favourably dealt by than if there had merely been an indictment against them at the sessions or assizes, because they had an opportunity ot bringing their case before the Court of Queen's Bench hefore the rule was made absolute. there any thing therefore, gentlemen, the conduct of the prosecution which in the slightest degree can be compjained nf ?\u2014There has been, it is said, subscription. Is a wealthy man like Mr. Muntz to be allowed to defy the law? he to be allowed to do whatever seems to be good him upon puhlic occasion, and then to say that he shall escape with impunity .-\u2014that he shall retain what counsel he pleases to come defend him. and that the prosecutor\u2014he curate, be he rector, or be he churchwarden\u2014shall not be assisted by the liberal bounty of his friends? Gentlemen, am much obliged to learned friend for having put in evidence that notice. In his speech, among other topics, he complained that a notice had been given Mr. Muntz to exhibit himself before you. My friend did nnt compliment. I must say, either you or my' Lord. in supposing that such an exhibition could have the remotest effect upon your minds; or that it could enter into the imagination of any human being that such an effect would be produced. But it turns out that notice was given to all the other defendants\u2014Mr. Muntz, Jlr. Pare, Mr. Peirce, and Mr. Trow; and it is notice which Lord may be aware a very general notice. It is a notice that the defendants on such an occasion may appear, that if any question of identity arises it may be settled an appeal to the persons supposed to have been present. There was nothing unusual or in the slightest degree calculated to give the smallest ground complaint upon the subject; but everything is to be turned against us, even the offer that, in \"a spirit of christian charity which has ever distinguished Mr. Moseley, I was instructed him to make, and which could not make without his authority\u2014that if these defendants would only acknowledge '.hey were wrong, would not follow such a precedent; that, in future, their behaviour should be lawful and orderly\u2014all that we asked was that; and then we were willing to forego punishment, and merely to gain the object which we had in view in instituting this prosecution. Because made that offer, the offer is to be turned against us ; and it is to said, our object is to have a triumph. Gentlemen, our object not to have a triumph ; but that justice may triumph that the law may triumph\u2014that those violations of the law for the future be put a stop to ; and you will not think the worse of Mr. Moseley, and those associated with him. that they were willing, on a concession on the part of Mr. Muntz, not to have called for any punishment; but he spurns it\u2014 he says I have done nothing amiss\u2014l am ready to do it again\u2014and all who look to precedent and my example are to learn from me what the law of England permits. Gentlemen, the speech of Mr. Sergeant Wilde was very eloquent; but I can't say it was very logical. cannot .r all praise friend for its possessing\" much reasoning and argument; and the reason was, that the subject did not permit of such materials being introduced into his speech. He gave you no analysis of the evidence; and why? because it would have shown there was a strong and conclusive case made out against his clients, and every one of the other defendants upon the record. Gentlemen, my learned friend said it is very late, and have occupied a great deal of time; but learned friend (and very properly so) does not care how much time he occupies, if it be for the benefit of his client; and you may depend upon it, gentlemen, he would not have had the slightest remorse in keeping you in that box until midnight, if he had thought that by sifting the evidence, and contrasting the story told by one witness with the story told by another, he could have derived the slightest advantage to hisclient; but he knew perfectly well it was much better for him to abstain from any such analysis, and only to say he thought there might be discrepancies in the evidence, and leave them for you to consider, but he did not venture to point out any one of them for your consideratiou. M learned friend has confidence in juries to certain degree, no doubt; but he always takes very good care to assist them when the evidence is deficient, unsatisfactory, and when it contradictory. Another most peculiar feature of my learned friend's speech consisted in this, that he entirely abstained, or, in a great measure abstained, from giving you the faintest notion of the evidence that he himself was to adduce; and why? Not from any squeamishncss about the length of time he might occupy, but because he knew full well that he had no material evidence to otfer; he knew that the evidence that would be given by the witnesses would be in a great measure consistent with the evidence that had been given on the part of the prosecution, and that his witnesses would be no value to him in proving the innocence of his clients. What did learned friend resort to, then, in the extremity of his case andinthemidstofhisdistress? Why, tothisargument, that this is political prosecution, and that you are politicians; and I even think he ventured (with respect, doubt) to insinuate that my Lord was a politician, and that he could not, with confidence, expect justice at the hands either judge or jury. I admit learned friend very dexterous, but it will not avail bim ; you, as little as my Lord, will be frightened from your propriety by the thebigwoids of Mr. Sergeant Wilde. Englishmen like fair play\u2014Englishmen like impartiality\u2014Englishmen like firmness\u2014 that all should discharge theirduty in their respective situations with integrity, and would say, with sternness\u2014always leaning to the side of innocence\u2014always administering justice with mercy; but at the same time treating, wont with indignation, but at least repelling any attempt that may be made to sway them by threats, any more than by cajolery. Gentlemen, what does my learned friend expect by representing this as a political case ? know not what the political sentiments may of those whom I have now the honour to address. You areall entirestrangerstome, but have nodoubt that you may be divided inopinion. What does my learned friend expect ? Why, that those who are on the side he supposes in their general feelings and wishes hostile to the part that Mr. Muntz may take in public life\u2014nay, to show their excess of candour, their great impartiality, their resolution not to aliow politics at all to mix up with the discharge of their duty as jurymen\u2014that they would be prevented from giving their verdict of guilty, which, as impartial and discerning men, they would feel it to be their duty to pronounce; or he might hope that with regard to those on the other side, who act generally in concert with Mr. Muntz,and who support the party to which he belongs, that they should enlist themselves as political partiz.tr that there might not be that unanimity in the jury box which is always desirable, and which could be confidently anticipated if politics were not mixed up with the evidence, or with the arguments in the case. But that, gentlemen, is a vain hope on the part of my learned friend. Sergeant Wilde, or of his clients. I care not to which side you or any of you belong. appeal to you as twelve English gentlemen, who are assembled to assist the administration of the justice of your country. call upon you and do so respectfully, remember the oath you have taken\u2014to look to the evidence, arid to find a verdict according to the evidence which has been given. must say that there is nothing of politics in this prosecution, from the beginning to the end of the discussion. must do both parties the justice to say, that politics were never interposed \u2014there were no political sentiments expressed either on the one side or on the other\u2014nor, except as far my learned friend found it convenient to put an infusion of politics into this prosecution, has it any political tinge. But, if politics were directly mixed up with it, may say from my experience that should enter a court of justice with the most perfect confidence with regard to the impartiality both ihe jury and the judge.\u2014Now, gentlemen, let me consider the case that 1 laid before you, and let me afterwards consider how it has been met. and how it has been attempted to answered. the first place, was theie not on the part of the prosecution the most complete evidence of what culled the corpus delicto I am not now considering how far the defendants were mixed up with it, that shall afterwards advert to. Was there not evidence of a riot\u2014of an affray \u2014of an assault\u2014of a breach of the peace? Let see what the evidence was gave, and whether it has been corroborated or contradicted ? was not surprised at question put by my Lord when the first witness for the defendants finished hisexamination. I asked if he bad made an arhdavit in the Court of Queen's Bench ? My Lord asked which side the affidavit was made. I will show you the great bulk ofthe evidence given on the part of the defendants strongly corroborates and supports thecasemade on the part of the prosecution. Gentlemen, whether Mr.Muniz, Mr. Pare, Mr. Peirce, or Mr. Trow were at all implicated in this transaction, I will show by and bye; but let me now draw your attention to what the nature of the transaction was, and what we have proved and stands uncontiadicted. There is meeting on Easter Tuesday, 1837, in the parish church of St. Martin's, Birmingham, for the election of Churchwardens. There are about persons present. The rector takes the chair, he names one churchwarden\u2014there are two condidates put up for the office churchwarden on the part of the parish. The poll begins \u2014one party is dissatisfied with the arrangements that weie made, and, I will show you, are dissatisfied without any reason. There is great uproar and confusion ; there a vote of censure on the rector, presiding as chairman ofthe meeting, and that vote of censure, by whom it was put, does not exactly appear the evidence of Mr. Douglas. It was then followed the resolution, carried with great applause and large majority, that Mr. Moseley, the rector, should be removed from \"the office, and another chairman should be substituted in his place. A foolish pretext is then made for interrupting the poll, by talking about electing a new Vestry Clerk for the purpose of consulting him. For the purpose also of delaying the poll a book demanded ; it is refused, and one party present, in a mannerthat was most exciting, and that had a strong tendency to lead to confusion, asks to be elected the representative of the people to demand a sight of the book, and that resolution being carried by a large majority, he immediately rises from his pew, and walks across, which is now proved beyond all contradiction, to take it by force. He goes to the place whete the rector situated, which became the signal for a great rush to the same quarter. There was a scuffle between that individual and another; there was a scuffle between two other individuals need not now name; there was a scuffle between a third party, shorn I need not now name; the pews gave aay\u2014there was crash on the one side and on the other, and there were cries of\u2014\"throw him over;\" \"pitch him over;\" \"pitch them over;\" \" tske force.\" The police were called in; a constable comes; the constable had his stall of office; they tried to wrest it from him they were rushing towards the pl. cc where the rector was sitting; the constable restrains makes use of the force necessary for that purpose, and he strikes them again and again. There was a general alarm ; there was a general confusion; some might remainunmoved in the midst of all this scene, which threatened such serious consequences; but generally speaking, who had only ordinary nerves and were\" present, were alarmed the highest degree; and one person who is dergyman of the church that holds it improper that any of their priests should present at scene of blood, withdrew to escape the sacrilege. There was the greatest ipprehension, gentlemen, and it had not been that the constable did arrive\u2014that he was assisted by a consideitble body of police\u2014life might have been lost, and the meat dismal consequences might have ensued. Gentlemen, not this a riot ? My learned friend was the first I think to question that there had been a riot here, and a political riot for so I thought that it was ullowed on all hands to have been\u2014a political riot; but what says my learned friend, it was no riot, berause they met for a lawful purpose. Now, gentlemen, will not critically inquire whether they met for a lawful purpose not. If they intended by placards the bellman, or by any other means, to pack the church, and to carry the election of church wardens by physical force, or to interrupt the proceedings, and to prevent that which the law sanctioned and required, they were not met upon a lawful purpose; but I will assume, for the sake of argument, that they were met for a lawful purpose. What, -hall it be said that if they were once met for a lawful purpose, that they could never undertake an unlawful purpose! and that nothing they afterwards do or say, or contravene, or sanction, can amount to riot? Gentlemen, I hold that it is not the law of England, while they are engaged in a lawful purpose, while they continue to pursue the lawful purpose, I allow that it will not be a riot, it would only be an affray; but if they meet for lawful purpose, and then they undertake an unlawful purpose, it the same if they had met originally for that unlawful purpose, and as if a lawful purpose had never brought them together. If they had an unlawful purpose in view the time of the disturbance, then I say that it is a riot Gentlemen, it would lead to the most disastrous consequences; for according to the proposition of mv friend, there never was an election riot since elections in England began. Why? because it is lawful to meet, either for a county election or borough election, the freeholders or burgesses assembled ; why, to be sure they meet for lawful purpose ; but having met for a lawful purpose they- mean to disturb the poll, they are guilty of a breach of the peace to prevent the election from going on as fairly as it ought to do according to law, and therefore, if they are guilty of any disturbance, say that that a riot. 1 think election riot is the most common riot that the law knows; but if the doctrine of my learned friend is to prevail, that never could amount to a riot, because they originally met for purpose that is lawful. Now, assuming that they did meet for a lawful purpose, I say, that from the time that Mr. Muntz put that motion to displace the chairman, to elect another chairman in his place, to prevent the lawful election of a churchwarden, that the purpose was unlawful, and that any subsequent disturbance amounted a riot. For. can it be doubted, gentlemen, that what was subsequently done was uulawtul \u2014that they entered upon unlawful purpose when they attempted to cashier Mr. Moseley, and to place another chairman in his room? My learned friend could not at all grapple with the difficulty that was thrown upon him of the ancient and immemorial usage England, that the Minister of the parish has a right to preside at all parL-h meetings; and when the George 111. was passed, so fully was the Legislature convinced of that, that they thought it unnecessary either to declare or enact such a thing. But what they say in the absence of the rector, or vicar, or perpetual curate? that then, and then only, that another chairman shall he elected. You therefore have the solemn recognition of that right by the whole Legislature of England. Therefore, Mr. Moselev being installed as chairman, say I am sure, without irreverence or disrespect that he had good a right it as Lord under the Queen's commission, has to moderate between us, and to administer the justice of the country. From tbat moment the purpose was unlawful, and what they afterwards did, the peace being disturbed, clearly amounted to a riot\u2014Gentlemen. I have not heard my learned friend contend, nor any gentleman that followed him, that this is not an affray. Is an affray a misdemeanour? there not in the information a count for an affray What is the difference between an affray and a riot ? It is in this respect \u2022 speak under conviction when I say that I believe the only difference is this, that with regard to a riot, all who are present are liable, whether they interfere or not; with regard to an affray, a man is only liable for thnt which be does or excites. it an affray, gentlemen, of what avail would that be Mr. Muntz? I dont call upon you to find him guilty merely because he was present \u2022 all gentlemen. 1 call upon you to find him guilty because be incited the not; bee?use he took an active part in it \u2022 because he was\u2014l not wish use any offensive language the slightest.degree but there is no word appropriate as that which am about use-becatwe was one of the ringleaders; and I say the tame of Mr. Pare Unless you believe that they did incite the riot that they encouraged it, tnat they partook m it, for God's sake find them not guilty; acquit them by all means. mean not at all to rest upon any egal subtlety, because they were present i' \" , hem a\"\" \u00b0y 'heir acts, by their words, and by their demeanour, taking that as the criterion. Gentlemen, how can you doubt, as reasonable men that Mr Muntz and Mr. Pare did incite this~nd that tbey took an active part in the proceedings Let remind you gentlemen, of the course that they pursued Mr. Muntz began very early, much earlier than was sup-\" posed by one ot the witnesses; and Mr. Pare began very early, and wished rip up what had taken place upon former election, and agitate the question to whether all the inhabitants had not a right to vote, for which there was no pretence, and which is not in the slightest degree countenanced any thing which has fallen from Arnold because appears quite clear that this a parish which is* not exempted from the operation of Sturges Bournes Act \u2022 and according to that act no one has a right to vote vestry unless he rated, and has paid his rates when de- a B Pass over all that Mr. Muntz did, and all that Mr. Pare did, until come to that important period m these proceedings when, first Mr. Pare proposed and then Mr. MunU made the formal motion of ejecting Mr. Moseley from the chair. Mr. made a motion to cashier the chairman, and he had the courtesy to ask Jtr Jloseley himself to put the motion, that he himself should be cashiered. Mr. Moseley refused, any man nerve, hrmness, and consistency wonld have done. What does Mr. Muntz do ? He supersedes him once though it is clearly the privilege of the chairman to put question to an assembled meeting; but Mr. Muntz himself put the question, and he called for a show of hands. Was not tbat, gentlemen, teaching the assembled multitude to disregard the law? Was not that telling them to set the law at defiance ? not that most inciting proceeding on the part of Mr. Muntz, that he should attempt to eject the lawful chairman from the chair, an.l substitute another his place? Unless friend could have called witnesses to contradict that fact; to show MunU never did put that motion that all our witnesses had swora on the subject was imagination or febricntion, it was useless in him to calll witnesses seek secure a verdict in his favour. And, gentlemen, this was the point at which he became liable for his conduct and which the law would not justify palliate. After what he did. in teaching the multitude they could eject one chairman and elect another he was answerable from that time for the consequences that ensued. But this is not a mere empty form ; for although there was not such violence that Mr. Moseley was taken hold of and tossed over the gallery, or kicked \"down stairs, and desired to get about his business, Mr. Wintieid, who I was at that One at the back of the gallery, was brough I forward\u2014he did present himself at the front of the gallery and there he stood up in front of the assembled multitude' that tlv-y might hail him as their new chairman. Gentlemen. Mr. Moseley displayed due firmness and energy \u25a0 be said will not leave this chair until the business of'the meeting concluded ; he kept his chair, and the plan o substituting a new chairman was defeated. What was then done ? Gentlemen.there wasone ofthe most frivolous pretexts resorted to for the purpose of disturbing the proceedings, and preventing the lawful election of a churchwarden, that ever was urged. Their object\u2014 mind the poll had now begun, the ten poll clerks that were appointed by Mr. Moseley were now stationed in different parts of the church-evidently was, on the part of .Mr and Mr. Pare, by violence to interrupt the proceedings, that no churchwarden should be lawfully elected \u2022 andwhat did they resort to? They complain the ab-\" \u2022ence of Mr. Arnold, although Mr. Arnold was absent from illness. Mr. Arnold had been elected twenty years ago \u2022 he was the unquestionable, the rightful vestry clerk of St .Martin s-they say that they will choose new vestry clerk without any fault being alleged against .Mr. Arnold\u2014without his having an opportunity of being heard, but in his abseiice-without notice being given, without which, as Lord will observe that act of parliament, nothing can be done at a vestry meeting-without any notice, they say I they will elect a new vestry clerk. But they knew there was pretence for the election, they knew Mr. Arnold would continue to be the vestry clerk, and their only object was to bring about confusion and mischief. They demanded the book. Now, gentlemen, what information was the book to give them upon this subject? Those who were assembled were old inhabitants, or the greater part of them old inhabitants of St. Martin's; they had been in the habit of attending the vestry meetings year by year They knew that Mr. Arnold had been elected twenty years ago and had been elected for life, and he would continue the lawful vestry clerk of the parish. As far as the proceedings of 1836 were concerned, those proceedings had actually been read the opening of the meeting, that they knew that at Easter, 1836, there had been no election of vestry clerk; that there was no pretence for saying that any such power belonged to the parishioners. W is their next step ? The Rector refuses to show them the book, not denying their right, but only saying what he was clearly justified in saying, that that was not the time or the place. He said\u2014\" this is not the time or the place,\"\u2014the object, evidently, that they had in view, being to interrupt ihe proceedings of the pall, and they having no useful intention, they did not have the book. respects any thing wbich relates to the election of churchwarden, it had nothing to do with respect to the election of churchwarden, but with regard to the supposed election of a vestry clerk, wbich they had intention whatever of insisting upon. Then Mr. Pare most unnecessarily\u2014most unnecessarily. I say most unjustifiably makes an appeal to the people, which had a strong and inevitable tendency to raise and excite them. What authority did he want from t!.e meeting ? Mr. Pare was rate payer-lie had all the right that belongs to rate-payer, but he would not proceed until he had been elected representative of the meeting. Now, gentlemen, ask you was not that a most inflammatory proceeding he was to be chosen aa their representative, and therefore he puts it to the meeting, whether he was not act as their representative, and they say \" we will, we will, we will we do! yes, yes !\"-and there are prodigious cheers. is allowed that a great majority were not rate-payer*, persons not privileged to vote; but ofthe mass there was large majority in favour of the proposition of Mr. MunU and Mr Pare, and according to some of the witnesses it appeared' as,fall had acquiesced Why was this done, gentlemen, it Mr. Pare had not at that time meditated breach of the peace, if he had been contented with doing what his counsel, Mr. Humfrey, said was his intention, which waa merely to get a sight of ihe book that had been refused before over and over ar.d again ? But he wanted refusal, and after he had been elected representative, if that was to give him Pew power and new functmns. would it not have been an easy thing for him to have got the remaining in the pew where he stood ? He had only to make the demand and then to appeal to a superior tribunal, and lithe election was invalid he might set it asile; but, instead of that, what does Mr. Pare do He gets tp, he leaves his own pew, there wereonly at that time two or three in the pew; but still he did out of the pew, his ibiect evidently was, and it cannot be concealed denied, to get into the rector's pew; that is r.ot disputed. There is no proof of his having forced himself into it; but finally, he did get into it; there is no proof of the force he originally u\u00abed, but object, most unquestionably, was to jet into the rector's pew. Now, just consider the state the rector's pew at that time. According to the evidence which has been given there were seven persons in the rector's pew, there was barely room for these seven to sit or to stand; and if any person wished to press into a pew so filled, it would tend to bring about a breach of the peace. But That cries were heard at that time ? Mr. Pare was present and he must have heard them. There were cries of \"take itby force '\" Why did not Mr. Pare then aay, \"no, f.r God's sake-*-1 mean no force, 1 mean nothing but what it peaceable and legal;\" but he still persists, and goes on until he is repelled Mr. Freer and those who were in tie rector* pew. Some of the witnesses who have been eximined here today have said that great furce and violence were used for the purpose of repelling him. He was, gentlemen, prevented from entering, and what was tbe consequence - Why what might bare been foreseen\u2014-vhat Mr. Pare must have intended, because it is a maxim in law, which I have often heard laid down by learned judges, that persons must supposed intend th* necessary and natural consequences of the acts that they do. Therefore say, reasoning upon that principle, it was the clear intention of Mr. Pare to act upon this suggestion, ra**- it byjon-e! and tbat forcible possession should ba taken W hat then took place? There was rush from the party the organ gallery ; there was rush from the school gallery which is part of the south gallery; and what is more, gentlemen, and do ask you most respectfully not forget this lact, that though the re. tor's party sat in their pew, all except Mr. Douglas, left the pew of Mr. Jluntz, tor Mr. Douglas said he did not know that any other person remained.-[Mr. SeryeanttlVilite. That is not so.-1 he A ttorney-Gcneral. say that it so, gentlemen ] know not who else remained besides. Mr. Douglas says he remained, and he is perfectly accurate. I shall show you that he saw very little and knew very little, but the others all disappeared. Then the rush was from the south gallery towards the rector's pew. from the back ' of tbe organ gallery towards the rector's pew, and from Mr. Muntz's side of the organ gallery towards the rec- ' tor's pew. What was the consequence? Why. gentle- men. this was the consequence, and must easily have been foreseen, and could not be avoided, there was such a scene of uproar and confusion as has seldom been wit- nessed. There were cries of \"throw him over \" pitch him over ! pitch them over .\"' and the Rector was in the greatest alarm. He says he was crushed -. was he not assaulted ? not crush an assault ? is crushed; those ! who were behind pressed hardly upon him, that he was pinned down to the front of the desk. Two persons attempted to get in from the south gallery ; there was strong j resistance made, and the post was defended for a certain time until Mr. Pare actually did succeed, the partition was broken between the rector's pew and the south gallery; the partition was broken inasmuch as two seats behind gave way. there was general crush and there was apprehension that life might be lost. What does Mr. Muntz do in the mean time? We are told that Mr. Muntz came to protect the peace. 1 think what my learned friend stated to you *as, that he did not come at all exercise his political influence, or to act in any other way than merely to protect the peace: his object was not to give Mr. infield a vote\u2014not at all to support what was called the anti-rate party, but he was there as the harbinger of peace. Gentlemen, never heard any person behave more whimsical than Mr. Muntz did that were his object Was it likely to produce pence in that meeting to accuse the lector of gross partiality, which he never retracted, and for which he never made any apology Was this likely to produce peace? was not it likely -o cause interruption from those who levered and respected the character and conduct of t he rector ? Was not likely to bring forward offensive expressions and violent actions on the part of thooe who were of the opposite party i Was it to produce peace that Mr. Muntz, who came for that purpose moved that Mr. Moseley should be removed from the chair, and that another should be substituted in his place 3 Was it to preserve the peace that he encouraged Mr. Pare not only in his vote of censure but in bis appeal to the people that he should be elected their representative Was it likely to throw oil upon the waves; hut beyond gentlemen, one would have expected that this peace-maker, who accustomed to address the public an oratorshould you not have expected that he would make some exertion for the purpose of Dreserving the peace ? Should you not have expected that he would have mounted, if not upon the ledge of the front pew, at least upon the seat ot\" the front pew\u2014that he would have addressed the multitude \u2014that he would have said, men of Birmingham, preserve your character\u2014you know the influence that I deservedly possess over you\u2014you know that you love, honour, and respect me\u2014l do entreat you as proof of that love, honour, and respect that you will behave yourselves quiet, orderly, and decent manner\u2014there is here great tumul \u2014there is great apprehension that some disastrous consequences may follow\u2014l see people rushing from the back gallery and from the south gallery\u2014 am afraid that something fatal may ensue\u2014l beseech you, my fellowtowsmen. to quiet peaceable, and orderly. No, gentlemen, Mr. Muntz h id made several during the course of that day of a very different naiuie, of an exciting nature, of a description to produce more disorder; but when disorder had arisen in consequence of those -peeches, he remained profoundly silent But he was not content with silence, he did not remain in tho pew where he was, but, according to all the witnesses, he first stepped upon the front of the seat, then he went in diagonal line, and he crossed the passage. For what purpose did Mr. Muntz rise from his seat during this stormy scene that was then going forward?\u2014for what purpose did he rise from his seat\u2014for what purpose did he show himself to the assembled multitude\u2014for what purt-oee did he clamber over the pews in a diagonal manner\u2014for what purpose did he place bis foot upon thepew behind tbe rector? Now.my learned friend asked witness, did you see Mr. Muntz attempt get into the pew behind the rector? have never said so; he was resisted before that took place\u2014his progress was resisted before he had the opportunity doing so; but this I dosay, can any reasonable man entertain doubt that his object m rising in his own pew\u2014in leaving his own pew\u2014in clambering over the backs of the pews\u2014and in going across to the back of the pew where the rector was, was to support Mr. Pare, and was to support those who that very moment were rushing towards the rector's pew for the I purpose of snatching the minute-book could have uo other purpose. Pare says, I left my pew that might go and inspect the minute-book. I could not conveniently my own pew. Tbat I mean to say is a shabby pretence; but even such a pretext has not Mr.'Muntz, for'he did not profess to say that he was going for the purpose of examining the book\u2014he did not say that he wished to read the minutes or the entries that were in the book. No, my learned friend, with all his ingenuity, dexterity, and fertility, has not intimated to you the slightest suggestion to account for Mr. Muntz leaving the pew and crossing over and placing! his feet behind that of the rector. The degree to which he made use of tbat stick seems to me not all essential, nor very material; but you will bear in mind that it is proved by five or six respectable wit- I nesses. whom I called before you, that in clambering over these pews he did flourish that stick around his headthat that was undeistood as a signal for the multitude, and that it produced a sensible effect upon those who were in the body of the church. There is difference with regard to the witnesses who have been called on tlie part of the defendant I shall and bye show to you some who say that he oscillated with the stick. Some say that it was accessary for his support, some say that he held it in his left hand, and some say they dont know in which hand he held it But I have called tive or six witnesses before you who positively swear that they saw him waving it round his head; and I will now make an observation, which perhaps may use the freedom of repeating, that in cases of this sort, gentlemen, positive evidence is altogether overwhelming against any negative evidence that may be adduced. I find respectable witnesses saying and pledging their oath that they saw such thing; if they can call twenty to say that they did not amounts to nothing all. Well but, gentlemen, that does not rest here, with regard to what Mr. Muntz did in this scene of riot and contusion. The constable comes in\u2014that most respectable gentleman, Mr. Rawlins\u2014and it is distinctly proved beyond all doubt that Mr. Rawlins was known by all Birmingham the constable\u2014that he was particularly well known by Mr. Muntz to be the constable\u2014that Mr. Muntz actually laughed at the person who did not know that Mr. Rawlins was the constable. So well was he aware of that fact, that he laughed to scorn any Birmingham man wbo was not aware of the fact,and this, notwithstanding the cross-examination to the likeness of the two brothers. But Mr. Rawlins could not at all be mistaken for his brother the attorney Mr. Muntz, because he (Muntz) declared that he knew'full well that this was Rawlins the constable, and not Rawlinstbe attorney. What was Mr-Muntz's duty to do. soon as he saw a person coming pniearra order, fort tried the authority ofthe law? It was his duty to submit; but what did he do, gentlemen According to my testimony, which not all contradicted. Mr. Muntz, instead submitting to the authority of the law when he saw Mr. Rawlins, seized the walking-stick that Mr. Rawlins had in his hand. That gentlemen, was an assault upon Mr. Rawlins which would support the count in tbe indictment whereby he is charged with assaulting with a stick. He seized his stick and tried to wrest from him, under the pretence that he did not know that Rawlins was the constable; that Rawlins actually took bis painted staff from bis Docket, and he produced it in the presence of Mr. Muntz. A number of street-keepers have been called. My learned friend represented his cross-examination that there were not more than two three ; we have proved fourteen\u2014his own witnesses have brought them to the number of eight or ten. The rush still continued. Rawlins, in restraining those who were pressing forwards against the rector, was obliged to do what the law will justify a constable in doing; he i-scd forces\u2014he inflicted blows\u2014he struck those whodisreg\u00bbrded his authority; and several those whom he was thus trying restrain, actually seized his constable's staff, and tried to wrest it from his grasp; but fortunately he had it secured to his wrist by a thong that is generally used by peace officers, otherwise, in all probability, the constable's staff would have been carried off as a' trophy the anti-rate party. Now, would ask, gentlemen, upon thi* evidence can there be the smallest doubt that both Mr. Muntz and Mr. Pare were the inciters, the instigators, the contrivers, and the participators nf this breach of tho peace ? But, gentlemen, it is ray duty likewise to draw your attention to the evidence against the other two defendants, Mr. Pare and Mr. Peirce. Sergeant Wilde extended his shield, by way of protection, to two other defendants, who had not. an immediate call upon his patronage, mean Mr Pare and Mr. Peirce. I think my friend bad not a word to say for Trow. I think that Trow was abandoned to his fate.\u2014[Mr. Justice Park. No -, Mr.Waddington made a speech in his behalf.\u2014The Attorney-General. Oh yes; and a most powerful one.] I was only talking about my friend. Sergeant Wilde. Mr. Waddington spoke most powerfully aad most eloquently for him, but only let me remind your Lordship \\ and the Jury of the course pursued by my friend, Serjeant Wilde. think tbat whenever Trow name occurred to my friend, that it stuck in bis throat, and I should have thought that it was the intention that Trow should be made the scape-goat; that Trow should he convicted, and that the others should get off scot-free. But let see, gentlemen, what the evidence is against Trow. Why so powerful that will only glance at it for moment Trow\u2014according to the witnesses that I called, and who stood altogether uncontradicted\u2014Trow came the pew immediately behind the rector, he tried to get into the rector's pew; stretched his hand for the purpose of grasping the book, and was only when he was repelled those who were in the rector's pew, who defended it as their citadel, that he was obliged to retreat\u2014[Mr. Justice Park. No, no, put his legs in.\u2014The Attorney-General. He put his legs in, and his legs were ejected; he put in his legs and his hands, because it was clearly part of the evidence that gave that with his hands he attempted to grasp the minute-book.] Now, if you believe that evidence, the case is made out against Trow beyond all contradiction. My learned friend seemed to think that here there was a riot here there was an affray ; that there was assault and that no one was guilty. Now, if neither Mr. MunU was guilty, nor Mr. Pare, nor Mr. Trow, nor Mr. Peirce, I should like to know who were the rioters ? Who were the assaulters ? Who were the persons who were answerable to tbe law ? However those are liable who incite, those are liable who act upon the incitement it may a circumstance of mitigation\u2014of great mitigation to Mr. Trow, if he is ill the manner that has been described, of which we have no proof, will take upon myself at once to say, that your verdict shall never give him any uneasiness; but I am\"obliged [Mr. Justice Park. never allow that argument to be used, it is way of entrapping the jury that I dont approve of.\u2014The Attorney-General. am much obliged to your Lordship, but I may beg leave to say to the Jury, and to press upon them, that we have no evidence whatever Trow being unwell\u2014of his being infirm, that he is ia a hopeless state.] am obliged to Lord for the caution he has given me; you are to look to the evidence, and upon the evidence say that Trow was then taking an active part in it. If he was incited by those who ought to have known better, who were persons of more influence and more experience, from whom an example of peace and subordination to the law might have been expected, that may circumstance of mitigation when he comes to receive the sentence of the law. But say that you have to consider this, and thi* only\u2014did he take a part in the disturbance; were his legs actually in the rector'spew ;and did he thrust forth his hand for the purpose of seizing the minute-book f Why, gentlemen, he actually doing the act which we charge upon him.\u2014Then, gentlemen, I have only at present to draw your attention to what is proved against Mr. Peirce. Mr. Waddington made powerful speech in his favour. But, gentlemen, I think he was little too minute, if may venture to criticise his speech, in detailing to you the evidence, for he actually went over a number witnesses that could leave no manner doubt at all that Peirce did take a very active part in the disturbance. Mr. Moseley said that he was taking very violent part in what was done. Mr. Foye said ot'Peiree that advanced tumultuous! towards the rector's pew. am now reading note of Mr. Waddington\"s speech. Mr. Gutteridge says, I saw him rush behind the back of the pew to get at the book. Mr. Bates says, I saw him rush behind the new. Mr. Guest says. I saw him rash up the passage, and Mr. Bates, think, gave evidence to the same effect. Well, then, he rushed up the passage, and he reached his hand to get the book ; he is foiled in that attempt, hot that attempt he makes at several fferent intervals.\u2014Gentlemen, there are other persons who might have been included in this information, hut it was thought more correct that only those who, either by speeches or by actions, took a principal part in it that they should be called upon to answer for the misconduct which they have been guilty. We might have included Mr. Wintieid. I: is said he was unwilling, that he was reluctant, that he remained silent the upper part the organ gallery, and that when he had been voted into the chair, he was so shocked by the misconduct others, that it was with the utmost difficulty that he could be prevailed upon to show himself in front the gallery. No wonder that it was so; was there ever such an outrage as to depose the lawful chairman aa election meeting, and to substitute his place one the candidates?\u2014 Gentlemen, all the witnesses call, venture say, are persons of the best character, both from the stations they hold, from their offices, and from their conduct, they are respectable men as could be called from the town of Birmingham, any town heT Majesty\"* donii- nions. At the head of them stands Mr. Moseley. upon whose character and conduct not even my learned friend, Mr. Sergeant Wilde, can make a single observation way t SU i re \" \u00ab , >Jr. Moseley tell yon? Gentlemen, dont mean to over with degree of a i the ' * , \"t just remind you what Mr. Moeeley says in de-crihmg tbe scene that took place. He says, \" that at the time the pressure was great, there were cries of ' throw him over from the body ot the church, and that he was crashed against the front of the pew ; and he was afraid he should forced over, or that the whole front of tbe gallery would give way, the pressure was so great There were exclamations throte hum over .'* from the body of tbe church and the gallervat the same time, and when the sears gave way.\"* Mr. fixes every one of the defendants. Does he not fix Mr. Muntz ? Does he not fix Mr. Pure ? Of whom, notwithstanding his altering the language of his motion in same particulars, he cannot say but that both his language, demeanour, and tone, were most offensive. Does he not fix Mr. Trow Does he not fix Mr. Peirce He tbat Peirce was actively engaged in the disturbance. Gentlemen, will not through the whole of the testimony the witnesses, but you have ten ortweKe different witnesses. Mr. Moeeley. 31r. Foye. Mr. Gutteridge. Mr. Bates, Mr. Freer. Mr. Knott, and Mr. Rawlins. Mr. Knott now confirmed as to having seized Mr. Muntz's stick, although several witnesses were called to contradict him on that point. We call Mr. Freer, Mr. Elkington, and Mr. Cox. and my learned friend has not ventured to make a single observation to the disparagement of any of the witnesses, except, I think, Mr. Foye, the Irish gentleman who talked ofthe shillelagh. Now. gen tiemen, you must make a little allowance for an Irishman. With regard to Mr. Rawlins, I not recollect a person whose manner and appearance would operate more a letter of introduction than his \u2022 he is carrying on a large business at Birmingham; he is the constable, holding onerous and gratuitous otfice. He states that the regular police had gone to Warwick, hut all the street-keepers were brought into the church. When the row took place, he came to restore order; and had he not come in\u2014had it not been for his interference, I think there reason to apprehend there might have been lose of life. Gentlemen, what reason have you. in the slightest degree, to suspect that the Rector, or the witnesses who followed him, have the smallest intention to misrepresent the colour, or pervert the evidence that they gave? you give credit to their evidence there is a clear and conclusive ease made out .-gainst all and each of the defendants. Gentlemen, the best proof that is\u2014that my learned friends were not contented with their ingenious, eloquent, and touching speeches, but that they called witnesses to the number, think, of fourteen or fifteen, they had not been aware tbat a clear and convincing case had been made out against the defendants, would my learned friends, considering their station at the bar\u2014their experience and their influence\u2014wonld they have allowed these witnesses to be called on the part of their clients? No, gentlemen, they would have acted upon their own responsibility, and they would have contented themselves with the powerful appeals that they made to your reason and to your feelings.\u2014But long list of witnesses is called and now let see what that evidence amounts to. Does it in the slightest degree touch the existence of riot ? Gentlemen, on the contrary, say deliberately that the evidence called the part of the defendants strengthens tbe case of riot, and strengthens it very considerably. For example, until the Editor of the Philanthropiet was examined, had not evidence of that roost important fact that there were cries from the south gallery \"/aire it hy force! take it hyforce loud cries of* take it by force not that fact most important ?\u2014does not that greatly aggravate the case with regard to riot and disturbance But let me see in what single circumstance there is in any degree a contradiction with regard to there having been riot and disturbance. It is said there were veils and hoot gs. One witness, and no other witness I think, was asked about the tambourine. He said that there was a noise resembling the rubbing of a thumb upon a tambourine. I think my learned friend had enough of that. He did not repeat it that time. As far as the riot goes, I say that the evidence called on lhe part of the defendants shows that it must have been more aggravated than was able to make out by the evidence on the part of the prosecution. Gentlemen. do not rely, as tell you,upon theyells or hootings, or the tambourine; but, gentlemen, do rely upon the cries of throw him over \"pitch him over!\" do rely upon other words that were used which I will not now repeat; and whether they came from one or from another, for the purpose of this inquiry, wholly immaterial. I do rely upon the acts that were afterwards done; it strengthens that which took place, the breach of the peace that was committed. There haa been a comparison two or three witnesses were called upon to draw a parallel between this meeting and former meetings at Birmingham ; it turned out tbat at former meetings there had been yells and hootings, and there had been police; but at no former meeting had there been a resolution carried to cashier the chairman\u2014at no former meeting had there been a demand from the Rector, after a refusal, of the vestry-book\u2014at no former meeting had any of the parties gone towards the chairman and tried to snatch the nook from his hands\u2014at no former meeting had the pews given way, or had there been cries all over the church\u2014at no former meeting was there any danger to life or limb\u2014it former meeting had the constables been called in, or had tumult been quelled by tbe officers of the law. It is upon this distinction, gentlemen, it is the distinction between the meeting on the \"JBth of March, 1837. and any former Birmingham meeting, that I rely; and, gentlemen, if there is such custom set at Birmingham, 1 think it will soon be put down hy a bill which has been brought into the House Lords, and of which Lord who presides here to-day has expressed his approbation. hope there will not be many more meetings either for a church-rate or any stirring questions in churches; but until the law altered they must take place the Town Hall, or somewhere else. That there was a riot\u2014that there '.-as an affray\u2014that there was a breach of the peace\u2014 is corroborated and confirmed by the evidence called on tbe part of the defendants. Let us now see how that evidence goes to exculpate anr of the four defendants, each being a participator tbat riot. Do any of them that were called \u2014beginning with Mr. Redfern\u2014do any them say that Mr. Muntx did not charge the rector with gross partiality ? Does any one of them say that Mr. Muntz did not move that Mr. Moeeley should be removed from the chair ? Does any one of them say that Mr. Muntz did not support and abet Mr. Pare, when Mr. Pare wished to be qualified a representative the parish, for the purpose of seizing the minute-book ? Did Mr. Muntzdoany thing in tbe slightest degree to exculpate him from taking a part in that proceeding ? We have called eight or ten persons who saw Mr. I Muntz actively engaged in this riot, who saw Mr. Pare, who saw Mr. Trow, and who saw Mr. Peirce all actively engaged in it. What do they do? They call some witnesses who say we did not see them ;\" but that amounts absolutely to nothing at ail. But, gentlemen, those witnesses, hen we come consider a little more narrowly the evidence they gave, will be found in some important particulars nearly all to contradict each other, and moat essentially to corroborate tbe testimony that given the part the prosecution. Of the ten or fifteen witnesses who were called, believe there were not two that saw the same thing. Several were called tbat never saw Rawlins, several were called who never saw Knott, several were called who were wholly unaware that Rawlins's stick had ever been seized by Muntz, several were called who were wholly unaware that Mr. Knott tried to seize the stick Mr. Douglas seems to be mainly relied upon by Sergeant Wilde. He made an excellent speech, expressing christian sentiments, in which 1 most heartily concur; they do him great credit, and have no reason to believe tbat Mr Douglas does not mean now to give fair account what saw. But. gentlemen, if you are to believe that nothing took place, except what Mr. Douglas describes, why, I think there would not be riot at all, because Mr. Douglas saw no one assaulted\u2014he saw no struggle\u2014he did not see Trow ejected from the rector's pew\u2014he did not see Peirce try to put his hand into the rector's pew\u2014he did not see Freer push back Pare\u2014he did not see Rawlins's stick seized by Muntz\u2014he did not see Muntt's stick seized by Knott\u2014nay, more than that gentlemen, he waa wholly unconscious there was any constable in the gallery. He saw some street-keepers, but they were doing nothing\u2014he did not see any constable\u2014he never heard the cry of \"take it by force !\" spoken to by the Editor ofthe Philanthropist \u2014he never heard the cry of \" pitch him over!\" Well then, gentlemen. I take Mr. Douglas as a respectable specimen of the witnesses on the part the defendants; he was not even alarmed you see\u2014Mr. Douglas was not even alarmed for Mr. Muntz. Mr M'Donneil, the Roman Catholic Priest, was very much alarmed for Mr. Muntz. he had feeling for the Rector, he thought tbat he was safe.\u2014he felt no anxiety about the Rector, but he was very much alarmed for Mr. Muutz. Mr. M'Donnel] was alarmed that he actually left the church lest he should present at a scene of blood, by which he might he contaminated and kept for a time from the exercise of his sacred functions. ere was Mr. Douglas all this time ? why, Mr. M'Donnell and Mr. Douglas were cheek by jowl, they were standing talking to each other; they were next door neighbours. It is a most extraordinary thing, Mr. Douglas standing by, tbat Mr. M'Donnell should have been so much alarmed that he thought there might be a loss of life. He was afraid he might be a witness murder, and he went away in great horror and consternation j and that Mr. Douglas, who saw all the same thing, should say that he never felt the slightest degree alarm, either for Mr. Muntz or the Rector, or any human being. Now, gentlemen, these discrepancies, I point out to you is showing that reliance at all can be placed upon the witnesses, however respectable, coming and saying \" did not see it\" Mr. Douglas did not sec any thing tbat alarmed him for the safety nf Mr. Muntz\u2014he did not see any crush\u2014he heard nothing\u2014he remembers nothing\u2014therefore, for that reason do you disbelieve the other witnesses that were called for the defendant ? No. gentlemen, let them describe tbe various scenes that Mr. M'Donnell did not see, or has forgotten. But however, gentlemen, there is a good deal shown by the evidence the part the witnesses of the defendants, which alone would he sufficient, if all the evidence for the prosecution was blotted out from the note-book of my Lord; there is abundant evidence remaining tbat was given by the witnesses for the defendants for the purpose of convicting them. appears from that evidence, not only that there was a motion to cashier the chairman, not only that Pare became the representative, upon his own motion, ofthe people; but there evidence, from what they state, that Pare most unnecessarily, as his purpose was unlawful and illegal, went from his own pew that the rector. There is evidence that there was signal for a rush ; and there is evidence that upon that signal the rush took place. I think the second witness said that the rush began at the moment that Mr. Pare got to the corner the rector's pew. Then, gentlemen, the witnesses on tbe part of the defendants prove that Mr. Pare unnecessarily got from his pew, and that he went towards the rector's pew; that his intention was to get only into the rector's pew, which was about seven feet long, and that at last he succeeded. Is not that taking part in the riot Would not that alone I sufficient to justify and require you to find a verdict against him ?\u2014Well then, what is proved by the defendants' witnesses with respect to Mr. ? Why. gentlemen, this is proved\u2014that when the disturbance had begun\u2014that instead of trying to calm it, he got upon the seat; he showed himself to the whole multitude that waa aseembled, they all saw that he had a stick in his hand ; and therefore, gentlemen, he had his stick his hand until Mr. Knott tried to take it; and why ? Mr. Knott has told you \u2014because beheld it up in threatening manner, and which lie thought indicated that blow was to be inflicted upon him. I should be veryunwilling. gentlemen, make any remark to the discredit of Mr. Douglas, but must say that it is an extraordinary thing that it happened just that time when Mr. Muntz had his stick seized by Mr. Knott Mr. Knott saw tbat Mr. Mur.tz was holding and\" flourishing his stick so to make him believe that a blow was to inflicted upon him. Gentlemen, If am incorrect I shall happy to be set light, hut I believe am only stating the evidence. Mr. Knott seized Mr. Muntz's stick, because he thought that Mr. Muntz held it in such manner that blow was to be apprehended. Now it is a singular coincidence tbat it was just at that particular moment that Mr. Douglas says, \" Muntz, give me your stick.\" Mr. Douglas a countryman of mine, and are said to be sometimes very prudent and cautious, and cannot help thinking that this prudent Scotchman, Mr. Douglas, at the' time that he said Muntz, give me your stick,\" must have had shrewd suspicion that it was to be used shillelagh, and that he thought was exceedingly necessary for the security of the peace, that that stick should impounded. What account did hegiveof his reason for saying Muntz. give me your stick ?\" Why,\" said Mr. Douglas. because I thought that if any blow was given at this meeting, would be laid to the blame that stick.\" Whether the stick isof that character, the gentleman who rises it not suffered always to peace-maker, which be endeavoured, he says, be upon this occasion, why should Mr. Douglas, the cautious Scotchman\u2014why should he suppose that it would be imputed to this stick any blow that was inflicted, or that might be dealt in any part of the church ? Gentlemen, I do most shrewdly suspect, although Mr. Douglas may have forgotten it, that either he had bad a little glimpse of thestrugcie between Mr. Knott and Mr. Muntz, or that be bad thought when Mr. Muntz was taking his stick over the Lops of tbe pews, and that it oscillating, mind you, tbat it might just by chance light upon the head of one of her Majesty's subjects and give it a severe crack. order therefore to prevent tbat oscillation, be said, \" Muntz, give me your stick, let me have it keeping.\" Gentlemen. call that corroboration, I call that important and powerful corroboration of the evidence that was given on the part of the prosecution. there had been really any contradiction, gentlemen, of our witnesses, or that they could any way have weakened the Important facts of the case. I should have thought that two materia] witnesses might have been called on the part the defendants whom you have not seen\u2014whom friend has not ventured to put into the witness-box. He , says he has great many others, 1 should like to know Mr. was one then ?\u2014{Mr. Sergeant IVUde. was.J \u2014The Attorney-Generat. Yes, gentlemen, my ! learned friend is abundantly prudent; old birds are not tone caught with chatf. My friend had Mr. Wintieid in bis brief, he says he had. Well then, when my friend looked over his evidence, he thought this will never do\u2014instead of making the case better, it will make it worse. The further we go we shail fare the worse. would not call him. But Mr. Wintieid is able give evidence ofthe greatest importance ; to the defendants He not called. am unite indifferent as to those who knew nothing\u2014whose evidence did not weigh one feather\u2014hut Mr. Winfield, who was at the top of the organ gallery, who waa candidate, who is called the bead the party, because is Winfield who is the new chairman that elected, and who came forward to show himself, not called. Now have great curiosity to know whether Mr. Edmonds is likewise in my learned friend's brief ?\u2014[Sergeant Wilde. Yes.\u2014 Mr. Justice Park. You bad better not ask. Brother Wilde will say yes.\u2014 Sergeant if ii.de. I will say yes. my Lord.] \u2014Tbe Attorney-General. Ml- ' Edmonds, believe, a very fair speaker, and he remained to the conclusion. Mr. Edmonds was a most material witness, if there had been any real contradiction to be given. It was great desideratum that witnesses should be called who were present and could recollect little or nothing. Find nut any that were in the organ gallery who recollect as little possible; but if tbey were in the organ gallery and recollect what did pass, and saw Mr. Muntz going over the pews with his oscillating stick, send them back to Bir- I mingham as soon possible. Mr. Edmonds must have been one of that class who were present who saw every thing, and who recollected a great deal too much, and for tbat reason Mr. Edmonds is not produced a witness before you.\u2014Now, gentlemen, I will not fatigue you by going more minutely into tbe evidence which has been given the one side or the other. The case now before you. You have paid the utmost attention to both sides. know that you will do justice between the parties; but I must call upon to recollect that no jury ever was impannelled in case misdemeanor to give a verdict that will of more general importance to the country in which we live. My learned friend urged, as one of the topics by which you are to be overawed, not to find the defendants guilty, for the people of Birmingham will be dissatisfied \u2014they will consider it a partial conviction\u2014tbat it a political case they will not satisfied with your verdict, and for that reason acquit the defendants. Gentlemen, you will pay no attention to whether the people of Birmingham will be satisfied or dissatisfied\u2014you will consider the testimony that has been given, and you will see how far it supports the charge that has been made, or bow far it acquits the defendants of that charge- And may be allowed to say, humbly, that it does appear me that the most lamentable consequences woidd follow a verdict of acquittal were pronounced by you in this case; for Mr. has denied that he in the slightest degree overstepped what waa lawful and proper\u2014he will make no concession\u2014no apology\u2014he says tbat he had a lawful right\u2014he haa said that what did he waa justified in doing*\u2014and he would be justified repeating. Gentlemen, although these meetings will not take place for the future in churches, they must take place elsewhere, the town hall, while the law remains that such elections are to be held. do not plead it in aggravation that this riot did take place in the church\u2014that is concern of to-day\u2014if it had been in tbe town ball Birmingham, and the same scene had taken place, the offence would have been the same, and your verdict would have been the same. Gentlemen, it seems to me, in these heated and excited times, that if to forth that there no harm in displacing the chairman appointed the law and constitution the country\u2014that there is no harm in resorting to force\u2014that there is no harm being guilty of a breach the peace\u2014if it is to forth tbat an election may be disturbed\u2014that may be interrupted, and that any frivolous pretext may be resorted to for that purpose\u2014l say that rhe present excited state of the country, the most lamentable consequences are to be apprehended. Not only will these scenes be repeated in Birmingham the next time the churchwarden to be elected, but you may expect that similar scenes will be repeated in other parts the realm with greater aggravation, and they may not all go off even in the manner which this fortunately did, without more serious consequences, and without loss of life. There another reason why I feel anxiety that such excesses should checked\u2014they bring discredit upon the popular cause. When our free institutions, which give us the right electing those who are to he employed in taxing us, or in governing us, are thus abused, there danger that our free tutions may fall into disrepute, and the people may turn away from these free institutions that are supposed to lead to such inconvenient and mischievous consequences, the silent and somewhat peaceful dominion of tyranny. Gentlemen, have done. I hope that I have not occupied more your time than the strict discharge of duty required. I have exerted myself to do my duty and to no more. I am now indifferent as to the result, but bare no doubt that the verdict you will pronounce will be satisfactory to your own consciences, and will satisfy tbe justice the country. Lordship commenced summing up about seven o'clock. The Learned Judge said the dependents were charged with rioting and preventing, hindering, and obstructing the lawful election a Churchwarden, in the parish church of Martin's, at Birmingham. The casehad occupied for three days the attention of the Jury, and it was bis bounden duty to request earnestly of every one of them not to permit any feeling whatever, but the feeling justice, to operate upon their minds. any of them did allow such a feeling to have influence upon their judgment, and the honest and conscientious discharge of their duty, it was a great offence in the eye of Almighty God. His Lordship had requested them on the close each day's proceedings not to associate with any tbe parties concerned, or allow any one to speak to them -, and be did hope they had been cautious in that respect. He earnestly entreated them to dismissa>l considerations from their mind, and dispassionately and deliberately to judge upon the case atcording to the evidence adduced before them, and the evidence only. It had been admitted by the Learned Counsel on both sides that thealleged offence having been committed in a place of worship dedicated to the service of Almighty was indignity that God, and offence highly be deprecated; and it waa esteemed very benious offence every sincere christian, because that church was place dedicated to his honour and worship. Still, if the circumstances would not have constituted a riot in any other place, it must not be considered a riot, merely because it was found to have occurred a place worship. was matter of consideration in tbe amount of punishment, but had nothing to do with the case in the consideration of the jury.\u2014He was happy to observe that a Right Rev. Prelate bad, upon tbe day the investigation into this case commenced, proposed a measure which if passed into a law would prevent all such meetings from taking place in future in parish churches. He was clearly of opinion, and had not the slightest particle doubt upon the subject, that the Rector, the vicar, or the Perpetual Curate had right preside all such parish meetings. It was positively decided by two most eminent Judges, Mr. Justice Bayley and Lord Wynford, when upon the bench, in the case -on v. Magmalh, about twenty years ago ; and it had afterwardsheen on tinned by that excellent and worthy man. Sir John Nichol, Judge of the Arches Court, in a most elaborate judgment delivered by that very eminent person. Tbe Rector, therefore, had a perfect right take the chair, according to tbe law of the land, and the decision he had referred to had never been appealed from. His Lordship thought in one point tbe Rector was wrong ; for he was decidedly of opinion that Mr. Moseley had no right to refuse the sight of the parish books to any person whatever who desired to inspect them ; and did think tbat hon. and rev. gentleman would not have acted as had done unless be had been ill advised to refuse the inspection. did think that if that rev. gentleman had been left to tbe exercise of his own honest and christian feeling, he would have prevented much the mischief that had occurred. The first question for their consideration was, whether there was a riot or not. In law riot meant tumultuous disturbance of the peace, by three persons more assembling together ot their own authority, with an intent mutually to assist one another, and oppose, violent and turbulent manner, any proper execution of the law to the terror of the people. affray, with which the defendants were also charged upon a second count in the informations, was completed by parties committing a breach the neace. without any previous intention on their part It would only remain for the Jury to decide, firstly, wbether or not the parties accused upon this information were guilty riot; the jury were of opinion no riot had taken place, then they would consider whether enough was proved to convict them of an affray. assist them in deciding, and coming a just and deliberate conclusion, would read to them the whole evidence on both sides, which, in his book, made upwards of-if pages. His Lordship then minutely and carefully went through the evidence adduced, on behalf of the prosecution and defendants, and concluded a most impartial and able summing up of the case by earnestly implorin- the jury dismiss every other consideration from their minds except that 01 administering justice to the parties, and to decide dispassionately and calmly whether they found a verdict for the Crown or for the Defendants. It was their province to decide upon the case, and in their hands he left it, anxiously requesting calm and deliberate decision. The Jury having retired, the .li nos wished to be informed whether or not it was intended to proceed with the action\" v. Armfield and another.'\" The Attor.nkt- Gkneral said he appeared for tbe defendants.\u2014Sergeant Wilds observed, that he was in the hands the Court, but the case, if proceeded with, would occupy considerable length of time.\u2014The Attornby-Gknxral said, as the Jury were out of court might be allowed to state to his Lordship the nature the action. It waa brought by Mr. MunU against the Proprietors of the Birmingham Advertiser, for describing the conduct of that gentleman to be the same that stated the witnesses for the present prosecution. The defendants pleaded justification, and the evidence would be precisely the same that in support the information. The Jcoex would state now, that, in his opinion, said in tha outset, the far better way would to withdraw a juror in both cases, and give triumph to neither party. To thia Mr. Sergeant Wilde assented, but the Attorney- General declined. After some further conversation, his Lordship declared that he could not try the action, but leave it as a remanel for the next Assizes. About twelve o'clock the Jury, after deliberation an hour and a half, entered the Judge's lodgings, and returned tbe following verdict:\u2014 \" On the second count for an affray, and Park \" guilty ; on the other twelve counts 'not guilty.' Pxraca \u2022\u2022 ir.d Trow all counts ' not guilty.' \" LONDON MARKETS. (From the Mark Lane Express of Monday.) The supplies to Mark Lane of Wheat during Wednesday and Friday were limited, and the market both days was very thinly attended, especially on the latter day. Millers purchase very sparingly, old Wheats at the present currencies, and few fine parcels of new offering, the business passing was limited, and the trade generally devoid of animation, and sales seconuary and ordinary desenptions could not have been pressed without submitting to | lower rates, a clearance therefore was r.ot effected. Bonded Wheat continues an object of speculative attention, but I the assortment good samples on hand this country being limited, induces holders to demand high rates, whicft range beyond the point purchasers are inclined to accede to, and though Dantzig qualities vary in price from 355. to 45a, per qr., vet the quotations are almost nominal, speculators wisely \"preferring to transmit their orders to the Baas II tic and Hamburgh where quotations are relatively lower. and choice samples superior; and this alternative was \u2022 I resorted to tbe past week to considerable extent which will no doubt further influence the foreign markets, and force the currencies. The Flour trade continues dull, and bakers seem yield with reluctance to the enhanced demands of millers and flour-factors, especially that portion the trade who do not rank with the top-priced bakers, and who sell lower rates to the poorer classes, whose wages unfortunately I not bear a gradationary improvement with the value of flour, the difference therefore can be only met by a diminution in quantity. Ship flour was also dull sale, and prices rather tending downwards. Barley has come to hand less liberal'y, tbe trade still rule* dull, and with the exception of the selected par- eels, the previous rates were barely maintained, especially sales were forced. Malt also heavy, and for the time even the finer samples hang on hand. The receipts of Oats having fallen off materially from Ireland, has enabled holdeis to quit their stock*, and the I samples offering being now of recent arrival, are not pressed ' on the market; factors Friday demanded b'd. per qr. ' more money, which purchasers refusing to accede to. checked tbe extent of business. Tho trade however closed firm, and the prevailing opinion in favour of further advance in the article; the prospects for which we will next week take the opportunity alluding to more large. Beans are in limited show, and folly dear. Peas though unaltered in value, were only in moderate request No alteration has taken place the duties. The English country markets the past week have in few instances increased upon their already enhanced currencies, i or if an advance of Is. per qr. has been noted, the sales ' have been very limited ; the trade however wa* extremely firm at tbe previous prices, and where quality was obtainable, ready sales effected. In a few cases, tha short I plies being attributed to the occupations of farmer' field labour, and tbat an increase of supply the termination of sowing will ensue, and a consequent diminution for the moment the currencies, are inducing some millers \u2022 from purchasing beyond their more immediate gsii** Oats are generally in demand, with limited improving currencies. rr\"m, Conn BxcslaNsb, Friday, Aunt* Wbeat- mm.

The declaration, coosisted of ten counts. The four first charged the defeudauts with composing, writing, printing, publishing a certain ' libel on the Roman Catholic Clergy of Ireland. The four with publishing it on ocrtaiu Roman Catholic Clergymen of Cork, the 9th aud 10th omitted parts this\u2014 The defendants pleaded A'of Guilty. Mr. Gentlemen of the Jury, yon have been put possession all the essential parts this informs. Tien toy friend Mr. Murphy, ivfaoiu you have heard today for first tiuie, but not the last, I \"hope and am sure. This is indictment for libel. I shall first briefly state tbe nature the law of libel you, under the correction t>f his Lordship; and naatsball put you in possession of the libel,on which ..we proceed today. I shall so- explicitly but briefly. Thal.is libel which directly indirectly esjiosres any person persons hatred, contempt, or ridicule. There is great latitude allowed in the interpretation this part of the law and, however, an advocate, I may regrpt this,, yet hound to say that you must administer justice on your oaths according to that \u25a0 law. not for nip to spy whether, it could he improved mid altered; it is enough that, stands, you must form your opinions and drcide by its direction. It matters not whether the libel .be true false. is enough that it slanderous, evcu though it may be true for if that which true be also slanderous, the publication of it constitutes a libel. But I rppst confess you, Gentlemen of the Jury, that I never toy mind or uty judgment, whatever it may be, to . this view the question, and 1 shall in this Case relieve the Jury of the trouble deciding this extended view for though the libel is equally lilieilous if- it false or true,yet has the prosecutor the privilege waiving this |>oiut; and accordingly, through me, this legal right is waived, we now offer the defendants the privilege pruviug t|ie truth of the charges made in that libel against my clients ; and, Gentlemen of tbe Jury, if they prove them be true, call upon you pronounce a verdict of acquittal. We offer here openly, and before tbe world the opportunity of doing this. I vow I have never yet been engaged in any case this uature, fur a prosecutur who refuses have the libel submitted to the test truth, and am happy to iulorm you, that in this case respectable clients anticipated tue in requesting that I would call on tiie defendants to declare by evidence this libel were true, ur a fabrication over the drunken orgies a desperate factiou. They tell them prove the truth if can, and if they caunut, will not your verdict will testify vuur opinion of the deed.\u2014 They hurl ilefi ance against them, dare tliein the proof. They bad an opportunity doing iu the higher Court, in the Court of Kiug's Bench, after an application was matte our behalf to grant conditional order file criniinaliufurmatiun against thein. The order was granted, and if they then had put in affidavits of tha truth of the libel, tbe order would have beeu made absolute, and never would have come down this Court for trial. They did not so then, and defy them now to justify it. Oue topic more, Gentlemen, before I read the libel Tor you. I aware that the Proprietors cf newspapers are' beset by the toils of the law in a very great measure, and that their situation is must perilous. They may assume that station either from high and holy principles of patriotism and attachment to the welfare mankind, or they may assume its perilous duties frum as mean inerceuarv motives as ever blighted blasted the faded and tarnished characters any dark and dangerous persons. But charge the defendants witli neither of these motives, and if they have placed themselves in a state peril here, at least are nut blame. We applied them for tbe name of tbe author of the libel; offered them this proposal iu writing\u2014to give up all proceedings against them if they complied, and they declined the offer. The libel professed to be written iu, and transmitted from Cork, ami we ooly required tbe name of the author. If it was not written Cork, what tbiuk you of tbe falsity of the proceedings ? it was written, it is a letter consequently in their possession, and we again offer them immunity they reader up to us the name of the author. We do not want to put or shackle the liberty the press; it is a legitimate organ freedom, but it, license we protest against, which perverts it from its pure and high purpose, and casts shadows and darkness when it ought to throw light and glory. But even although tbey will not give the miscreant author up to Us, yet will they escape. There are those behind the curtain who will pay all expenses incurred this cause. Tbey are to be recompensed, they are be indemnified for standing between the real author aud punishment. If they are the authors of this libel themselves, they too will suffer as they deserve, and in either case the ofteuders will be punished! Gentlemen of the Jury, I shall state the libel itself, prefacing with few remarks as the circumstances that gave rise to' it.\u2014 The lihel relates to the Cork' Election 1826, event which much party and personal interests were mixed up. But with these you, as a Jury, have nothing to do; you ought to be free from all such stain. You stand in the temple Justice, aud it would be the foulest blasphemy tu tinge her sliriue with aught of a party hue.

Mr. WAGGETT \u2014What counts of the information will you submit to tbb'Jury Mr. of them. Mr. WAGGETT\u2014 want to show that the riot which occurred is named in the libel, and which has been admitted by even the witnesses of the jdaiiitiffs, led the very remarks in T'ie Evening Mail, of which much aud so loud complaint has been made. The declaration states that these remarks constitute a libel of, aud concerning certain Roman Catholic Priests of aud belonging the City of Cork. It also complains libel the whole body of the Catholic Clerg/offrftamf. Now it cau allude particular persons at oiie and the same time, really goes beyond my comprehension. The certain persons against whom the libel was stated,! contend could not mean once the whole Catholic Priesthood ot Ireland, and ouly that uf.C'urk. The imtendoes were not proved ,to be against both. I therefore request that your Lordship will explain the Juiy the nature the last on this bead, and inform tbein how far the paragraph is and is not a libel. CHIEF BARON\u2014I regret, Gentlemen of the Jury, that I have 'discretion whatever this head. The law presents an anomaly in the present case, for the Jury are appointed Sole judges hot only of the merits but also the law of libel cases. Taking away the right of deciding or even off ering an opinion the subject from the Court, it leaves the Jury the duty deciding for themselves. Mr. WAGGETT\u2014II did intend,. Gentlemen of the Jury, addressing you in 'different manner from that which I now feel it my duty to adopt. You will excuse iny addressing myself to you on the legal points connected with this libel; hut as the law has constituted you sole judges what is a libel, I certainly excusable in talking to you of what you dou't understand. A libel must be directed against' au individual or individuals, known personally, because if they are not known they cannot be brought into \" hatred, couteitipt, or ridicule,\" which, as Mr. O'Cuuueil has must eloquently informed you, must be created to render the publication acticuable or criminal. Now, if the body libelled be not kuowu or recoguized, they cannot at all he warranted in bringing actiou fur libel; and, although I entertain much respect aud esteem for the Roman Catholic Clergy individually, yet I must say that there be auy such body as the Roinau Catholic Clergy, they are uot rec 'gnized by the state, and, as the state did uot recognize any body, warranted in saying that they could not libelled. To bring the matter nearer home\u2014to own profession, the Bar, it sometimes, libelled in a general and playful manner. We are called wicked rogues, knowitfg fellows up to all sorts chicanery. a book were written, saving, that the lawyers of Dublin, were an improper set of fellows, ever aDxious for tbe return of Assizes that they might harvest for their pockets\u2014holding out their hands for money, and anxious to run uff when they get it; who always will take care to look at the notes they get before they peep into tbe brief itself\u2014if a lawyer was to bring an action for this what Jury would nut smile at the idea uf being called to consider it as a libel. There was once writer named Shakspeare who existed a long while since; in one of bis plays, As you lihe it,\" introduces' the melancholy Jacgues, making an observation so much to my purpose, that will introduce it here, \" What woman iu tbe City I uame. When that I say, th,e City bears The cost of Princes unworthy shoulders.? Who rail come in and say that I mean her. When such a is she, such is her neighbour ? chidiug like a wild goose Hies, Unclaimed of auy man.\" So say I of this, no Priest can come forward and say that he is meant. did intend pursuing the parallel beyond own profession, but 1 see that what 1 have said is quite sufficient that head. When the late Queen, the wife of his present Majesty, died, there were a variety opinions respecting her; some parties esteemed Iter very highly, others quite low the opposite scale. The Clergy of Durham were among the latter class, and they ueither hung their cathedral with black cloth, ordered the bells be rung. They let her her great account without any customary honors. Some person published a paragraph a newspaper, accusing them of want of loyalty.. This body, which was of a tenderer sensibility than others, conceived itself aggrieved, and brought the matter before the Court of King's Bench, which Court ruled it to he a libel. The Court must,, course, have had very good reasons for wrhat they did, but did nottcll what they were ; the case occupied only a few lines the Law Reports ; allowed the information to granted. may safely iofer that that case had not heeu so ruled in England, the Court Kiug's Bench Ireland would have refused this information, but having the precedent established in the one case in the English Court, the Irish one conceived they could well refuse leave make the order absolute this case but it is a solitary decision. 1 have said it was my iuteutiou speak disrespectfully of any religious persuasion ; 1 intend uot to do but I must say that the Human Clergy are just in the same situation of those of Durham iu 1821. Formerly an objection w as made such procedure, for was then held that libel could apply to any body people generally. The decision to found Hex v. Alnie and Knott, '6 Salkehl's Rep. There a verdict was' returned agaiust several to the Jurors unknown. The objection ''when against an order general it is libel, must descend to particulars,\" ruus guatuor pedibus with this and the Durham case. This is no reflection a known body, recognised by. the law. There are three four thousand Priests, which of theui particularly libelled ? \u2014Three or four of Mr. O'Keeffe's clergy made themselves busy at the Election j he himself declined' interfering, yet he throws himself front of the battle as the valorous Agamemnon of the cause, -and Afr. as his pretty page.

{"ocr": "CORONERS' INQUESTS. ELECTION RIOT AND MURDER.--An inquest was last week held at Enniskean, on the body of Michael Whooley, who came by his death from injuries received in a riot at Ballineen, during the Cork county election. The riot had first taken place in consequence of a passenger wearing a green branch and huzzaing for O'Connell and Roche. This time it terminated without any serious consequences. The deceased was afterwards seen near the cross in Ballineen, beating his sons home. A party came up with the Whooleys, when William Good and Charles and Robert Gay were seen armed with sticks, staves, or bars of iron, but it was too dark to be discovered which. These three men were seen each to strike the deceased a blow and then run off. One of them was immediately after heard to say \"There is now a case for them ; let them take him home and salt him.\" Another witness saw a man named Richard Damery throw a stone at the deceased when about ten yards from him, which struck him on the bead, and he fell lifeless on the ground. William Good immediately afterwards came up, and leaped upon his body. The jury returned a verdict that the deceased, Michael Whooley, died on 18th July, in consequence of serious injnries received by a stroke of a stone, wilfully and feloniously thrown by Richard Damery on 14th July, and that William Good, William Damery, and Charles and Robert Gay, abetted in the felony and murder.\" A MAN DISOWNS HIMSELF AND ANOTHER LOOKS ON. \u2014Considerable sensation was excited in this city on Tuesday afternoon, by the report thatla man had thrown himself into the Basin and was drowned, and that his companion, instead of rendering assistance, stood coolly smoking his pipe. The report turned out to be true. The man who committed the rash act was John MU, a shoemaker, and the person who accompanied him to the fatal spot was a poor rag of a creature named William Brown, a tailor. They had been drinking together the greater part of the day, but separated about five o'clock, Rill leaving Brown about the premises of the Swan and Falcon public-house. About seven o'clock 11111 rereturned and asked Brown to walk with him towards the Basin, in order thatihe might receive some money due to him by a ship captain. On reaching the Basin, Hill, all of a sudden, threw off his waistcoat (he wore no coat) and hat, and exclaiming \" Good bye, Bill,\" threw himself into the Basin. Brown went to the edge and looked at the drowning man, then picked up the hat, putting it under his atm, and eat down quietly on a convenient resting-place smoking his pipe, with as much indifference as though nothing particular was going on. An inquest was held on the body on Wednesday, when, after Brown and several witnesses had been examined, the jury returned a verdict to the effect that the deceased had drowned himself, being at the time in a state of temporary insanity, with a strong expression of censure as regarded the conduct of Brown.\u2014Gloucestershire Chronicle. SUICIDE THROUGH DISTRESS.\u2014Last evening an inquest was held at the Sieve public-house, in Charlottestreet, Minories, before Mr. Thistleton Dyer, coroner for the precincts and liberties of her Majesty's Tower of London, on view of the body of Frederick Hughes, a journeyman cork-cutter, residing in that neighbourhood, aged forty-six years, who terminated his existence by hanging himself on Saturday last. From the evidence it appeared that the deceased, who had formerly been much addicted to habits of drunkenness and dissipation, had been out of work for some time past, and on Friday evening last had been told by an officer of the Court of Requests in Osborne-street, Whitechapel, that unless he paid the amount of a tally bill by the Tuesday following he would be taken in execution and sent to prison. This circumstance had evidently preyed upon his mind, and on Saturday last, during the temporary absence of his wife, he sent his children oat of his room and hung himself by a cord from a nail in the wall. It was also proved in evidence that the prisoner had on a former occasion both threatened and attempted to hang himself, and the jury returned a verdict of \" Temporary derangement.\" DEATH IN THE HOUSE OF Coaascirrox.\u2014Yesterday afternoon a Coroner's inquest was taken before Mr. Wakley, in the House of Correction, Cold-bathfields, on the body of Thomas Osborn, aged 29, a prisoner, who died in the jail. It appeared from the war rant of commitment that the deceased was brought into the prison in the mouth of October from Newgate, having been tried and convicted at the preceding Central Criminal Court of a charge of cutting and maiming, for which he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the House of Correction. It was adduced in evidence, that for some months past the deceased had not been put to hard labour, and that he occasionally worked in the garden. Ile was so employed on Friday last, when he was seized with a dysenteric attack, which resisted all attempts of medical skill to prevent a fatal termination. Several witnesses were examined, whose evidence tended to show that the utmost attention was paid to the deceased. Verdict, \" Natural death.\" After the inquiry the jury . asked permission of the governor to be allowed to view the interior arrangement of the prison, the treadmill, the sleeping cells, the cells for solitary confinement, both for the males and females, and the chapel, which was granted. ALLEGED DEATH BY VIOLENCE....YeSterday an inquest was held before Wm. Carter, Esq., the Coroner for Surrey, at the King's Arms, Roupell-street, Lambeth, respecting the death of Mrs. Sophia Amelia Bennett, aged 44 A report had prevailed that the death was the consequence of a blow on the forehead, which was very visible ; but Mr. Havers, the surgeon of Yorkroad, who had made an examination of the ;\u2014T body,. de-1 posed as follows here MO a bruise on the right forehead, and, upon examination of the scalp, he discovered a redness under it, but this would not be sufficient to occasion death. The base of the skull bad considerable disease of long continuance, which he had no doubt was the cause of death. The death. was, in in his opinion, caused by the rupture of a blood-vessel of the brain, caused by disease, and not violence. The testimony of Sarah lleplar was to the effect that, upon going to the deceased's house, No. 37, Brad-street, Lambeth, she found her, on Thursday morning, lying on the floor, foaming at the mouth, and unable to articulate. She was alive, but perfectly insensible. Mr. Hancock attended, and advised the proper remedies such as the application of warm water to the feet, a glass of wine and water, Etc., but the deceased died on Thursday, at two o'clock. After the summing up of the Corocer the jury deliberated, and returned a verdict of \"Natural Death.\" OMNIBUS SPECULATIONS.\u2014Yesterday Mr. Walley held at inquest at the Robinson Crusoe, Earl-street, Lisson-grove, on the body of William Morton, aged fifty-one, one of the - original speculators in omnibuses, latterly a contractor, but more recently without any employment. Edward Wright, an omnibus driver, residing at No. 31, Little Carlisle-street, Edgware-road, said deceased was a lodger of his, and that about four o'clock on Saturday last witness sent his daughter, aged nine, to deceased's room to call him down to tea. She returned quite alarmed, saying, \" Mr. Morton looked very white in the face, and had a string round his neck.\" Witness was then in the act of cutting bread and butter. lie ran up stairs with the knife in his hand, and seeing deceased hanging, he cut him down. He was quite dead, and a doctor who was called in tried ineffectually to bleed him He had cut one of the bed cords in half, and with it hanged himself by the neck from a crook in the ceiling. By the Coroner\u2014l saw him reading a book about eleven o'clock on Saturday forenoon, and I then told him, his rent being in arrear, that I had let his room to another. He replied, very carelessly, \" Oh, have you ?\" He was formerly in partnership with Mr. Shillibeer, the omnibus proprietor, and lost upwards of 2,0001. Since then he became a conductor, but eight months ago lost kis situation through drunkenness. Ile was extremelylonely and dull, except when be was drunk, and latterly he was never a day sober. I am confident he hanged himself. Several of the jury said they knew deceased. Ile was formerly a large innkeeper in Southwark ; but being in Paris with Mr. Shillibeer, at the time omnibuses were first started in that city, the latter told him he was sure that similar conveyances would succeed in London. Upon this hint deceased sold his inn, and became partner with Shillibeer in running the first omnibus from the west end to the city. In this speculation he lost between 5,0001. and 6,0001. So heavy a loss led him to dreadful habits of intoxication. The coroner, addresssng Wright\u2014Do you think that drunkenness brought on insanity, or that insanity led to drunkenness? Wright\u2014l think the man must be insane to drink as he did. I have known him drink a bottle of brandy a day for twelve months together. Ile formerly attempted to cut his throat with a razor, and on Friday night last he asked another conductor to lend him a penny, saying he wanted to buy a cord wherewith to hang himself. Verdict, \"Temporary insanity.\" ELHAM.-SINGUI.AII CASE.\u2014Mrs. Marsh, of Elham, whose death we noticed in our obituary of last week, had been afflicted for eight years with a violent pain in her side, seven of which she had been confined to her room, and her body was swollen to an amazing size. After her death a past marina examination took place, when a tumour was extracted from her side, which weighed the extraordinary weight of 63 lbs.\u2014Maidstone Gazette. COEBURN'S NEW MONTHLY MAGAZ INE AND HUMORIST FOR AUGUST, EDITED EY THEODORE HOOR, Esq.\u2014 This magazine should thrive, if eminent contributions can bring grist to a publisher's mill. The Editor, Hood, Mrs. Trollope, Blanchard, Poole, and Jerrold, are palpable pen-labourers at the vocation of the periodical, and there are clever anonymous articles besides. The paper on \"Screws\" is, par exemple, full of informing satire and useful exposure, and there is no disputing the blended bitterness and wit of Mr. Jerrold's stinging illustration of \" The Manager in search of a Star.\" We wish, in spite of our appreciation of the force of his ridicule, that this author would write in a kindlier spirit. Poole is just half as merry, and not half as morose, and his drollery you can enjoy with something like sly hilarity.

{"ocr": "ELECTION COMMITTEES. COUNTY OF CORK. SEVENTH DAT, AND CLONE OP THE IN\u25a0J'JIRT The committee assembled on SatnrdaT, the usual hour. Mr. Serjeant said, that Mr. Ware, the clerk of the feme?, who was unable to attend en Friday, was row oreaant, but, by same fatality which seemed attach Irish witnesses, had the document he was called to prove bebtnd him\u2014not, however, in Ireland, but in another part of the town. bad sent for it, snd he hoped it would soon arrive. To save the time of the committee, proposed to pnt in Parliamentary return of the number of nersons enticed 10 vote for the county Cork May, 1841. Mr. Austin said, would admit this, not conclusive evidence, bat tic bene este, until the production the registrybook. From this report it apnearsd tha* the number of persona i entitled to vote in Maj, 1841, was Mr. M. Smitji then rose and said, that the evidence the part of the petitioners being closed, it became his duty to \u25a0am up their case, and to state, as succinctly as possible, the grounds npon which he called npon the committee set aside the election. This inquiry was most important to all parties concerned\u2014to the sitting member*, the petitioners, and to the constituency. It was of more importance than even a case of eorrontion and bribery, for was the first time during this session that an election was sought to be set aside an the of riot and intimidation. Acts of this sort \u2022rent to the essence and principle which election was founded. From the first moment the Commor.s obtained representation, freedom election was secure to them. By act passed in the third year of Edward 1., it declared that, Bfcaose elections onght to free, the King comsnandeth, npon great forfeiture, that no great man, nr other, force anna, nor by menacing, shall disturb any malie free election.** The same doctrine was laid down in all the text books, by Lord Coke, by Mr. Justice BUckstone, and Mr. Serjeant Heywood. The cases in which elections had been set aside for rot and intimidation were collected in Perry and Knapp's Ifepnrts, pave 338. The election for Pontefract was set aside J4. for Southwark 1702, for Coventry in 1706. and 1722, for Westminster in 1722. Coventry again in 1736, Westminster I again in 1741, and Pontefract again few years later. The first case in which committee had refused to void an election lor riot was the Coventry case in 1837. Bit that case the defeated candidates had retired without re'e.rence to the riot, and without protest. The next was the Rexbnrgh ease, and that decision would venture say that it could not be justified by any lawyer, it was opposed ancient precedent! to present opinion. Yet there was a stone distinction; between that case and the present, for there the riot was confined to one of the polling places, Hawick, and the voters were assailed after they had polled. And Lord Cockburn\u2019s judgment in passing sentence on some of the Hawick rioters was opposed to the decision of the committee, for it was his opinion that the oatragee in question did interfere with the freedom of election, though they were committed after the voters had polled. The state of the law was this \u2014that if by rioting and outrage voters were prevented coming to the poll, and there were enough of an polled voters left tarn the \u2022lection, the election was void. The general facts of the present case were these\u2014that Mr. Leader was supported large body of voters, that when was equal or superior on the poll to the other candidates, he was compelled by the riotous state of the town and the outrages committed in the county to apply to the assessor to adjourn the poll. This \u25a0bowed Mr. Leader\u2019s anxiety to continue the contest. But when found that this was refosed,tbat all his arrangements for bringing his voters were thwarted.that his friends were as- Multed,and that the utmost protection the military and police oould afford them only extended from his committee-room to the Court-house,sndwas inadequate to protect them elsewhere, acted prudently in not continuing the contest; and could election, held nnder such circumstances, stand, when it depended not on the number of voters, but upon the number soldiers What a precedent would this afford for fa\u2019nre \u2022lections ! What power wonld it throw into the hands of \u2022ny Government! Mr. Smith then proceeded to comment the evidence, and contended that it bad been proved that riots had existed sufficient to strike terror into the minds men of ordinary firmness, that many were actually deterred thereby from giving their votes, and that the sense of the \u2022onnty could not be laid to have been taken. Tfce Beerhaven voters had been treated more like invading army than persons going to exercise important duty. By the ill usage they received, seven votes were lost to the Conservative party, and those who reached Cork in safety owed it to their being unknown. At Kanturk voters had been prevented by perso\"?* constraint from going to vote for the Conservative candidates ; and this was the caw with Connor Murphy Glonakilty. What effect these outrages must have produced upon the minds of other voters in the same interest might easily be imagined. The outrages in the city of Cork had been proved by the official persons who had been called, and bad been corroborated by the sufferers themselves. It had < been proved that there were not military or police sufficient to protect each voter; and that the mob was unsafe was evi- ' denced by the fact that cards were given to voters in the in- terest of the sitting members to protect them. He should . put in the register to show that there was a sufficient number j of voters left nnpelled to turn the election. conld not call i the 2,000 unpolled voters to prove which way they would have voted, nor coold produce the eanvass-books, as they were not legal evidence. It was r.o defence, even If the facts were so, to say that there was greater ( amount of riot than other elections. Bribery at , Ipswich had not justified bribery at Southampton, conld bloodshed at Cork be justified by bloodshed at Galway. That women were prominent in thew proceedings only rendered them doubly dangerous, by encouraging one side, and in a degree disarming the other. The march to Versailles, , which broke into the Queen\u2019s chamber, was headed by wo- , men. The mob acted in concert, by design, and had one single object in view\u2014to prevent by any means the return of a Conservative. Future elections depended on the resole of the discussion that day. He felt certain the committee would sot make a precedent legalizing riot, but would by their decision teach the mob that their efforts were in vain, and thus more to render elections free than troops of dragoons and Regiments of infantry. Committees this session had struck the root of undue influence means bribery and corruption in elections in England, and he trusted this committee would strike st the root of the same evil in Ireland, intimidation. [He concluded by imploring the committee, for the peace of inland, to declare the election void. Mr. Ware, the clerk of the peace, was then examined, and stated that the registry-book was at the bottom of two tons paper, which he had brought over in pursuance of the .Speaker\u2019s warrant. The register was only purged by effluxion time, once in eight years; he never struck oat name Once in it, though the person might be dead or have lost his qualification. From communication with the agents both sides, he should think that from 3,000 to persons could have voted at the last election. Mr. Austin thenroee and said that the evidence of the 24 witnesses who bad been examined on the other side had Weakened in strength from day to day. This petition would never have been neard of, if Mr. Barry, the old member, bad continued to sit. The riot at the city election was much worse, and yet no petition had been presented there. The object of this petition was nothin* else but to attack and harass the most eminent member of all Ireland. There was not breath of suspicion against the character of the sitting members; the petitioners had admitted that they had had no participation the alleged nots. It was alleged that there were riots in the county, and obstruction iu the city, whereby freedom of election prevented. The law this point had been pushed his learned friend to extravagant extent. Riots and intimidation did not necessarily void the election, it must be shown that the majority was thereby affected. If there was a majority of 50, and 10 of that majority had been kidnapped from the other side, could it be maintained that such a fact \u2022would void the election 1 As to the Roxburgh committee, he would that a larger number of distinguished men never sat upon any committee, and the decision they came to waa, in hia opinion, perfectly right, although it was against himself. Their resolution was, that the riots were not of snch a nature to prevent the votes being taken in the election. It was a very easy thing to prove that riots had taken place, but it was very dangerous to set aside an election on that account. Against bribery, against coercion by landlords, it was necessary to come to Parliament to relieve, bat against rioting the Legislature had always given a remedy at the poll, viz., adjournment, and this was especially the case in the acts relative to Irish elections. The real question was, whether the assessor, Mr. Collins, was right in refusing to adjourn the poll, and should be surprised if the committee overuled his decision. The allegations in the petition had reference almost entirely to the agitation in the county, and yet the cose bad been conducted as if it related only to outrages in the town. had to complaia of most re- moos allegation in the petition, charge contain the itrated venom of all \u2022which seemed to \u2022> coucenU-.^\u2014 -- th? Grange Clnbs in Cork, upon which no evidenoe had boon ered. It was that the Catholic priests had, from the altar, excited the people to agitation and outrage. If they had been | really guilty, they would have deserved ail the epithets which had been cast them. But was it be tolerated that such a charge should made, and that no evidence in support of it .ouM be offered 1 The had shown quite the contrary, and that so far from agitating, the Catholic clergy had interfered to protect the Conservative voters. Wi:at witnesses were called to prove the allegation, that a system of agita'ion, menace, violenc-, and outrage had been established and acted on Thtse facts, true, must have e\u2019ear ?.s the sun noon, and yet the only witnesses called to prove them were notorious Orange Conservative had also to complain of the tone of exaggeration which the witnesses indulged. As to the Bantryi case, of which much had been said, what were the facts ? i A number o! Catholic voters on Lord Bantry\u2019s estate had been shipped board the good ship Sophia, and consigned to Cork vote for Lord Bantry\u2019s friends. Was this freedom of elcc\u2019ionJ had been said of the tyranny of the feudal barons, but it could exercised as well by band clothed i\u2019aris clove. Might not the liantry people have thought Bantry\u2019s Catholic tenants might prefer voting fir O\u2019Connell and Roche, to voting for my lord\u2019s friends?

The Reformers have triumphed in Dublin, and still more So nouslyin Belfast: they have also driven 'he enemy from Athlone, Carlow, Drogheda, Sligo, and IkSSK Here a.c nine seats plucked from under the Tories or eighteen votes gained for Ministers. The losses of Antrim and Newry will be amply compensated by the popular success in the Queen's County, and the coun- ties of Carlow, Cork, and Langfordf We have no hesitation to predict that in each Of these Constituencies the Tories will be signally defeated. The total gain will then be fifteen seats, from which number deduc. three on the score of disasters, and the whole acquired strength to the cause will he eleven Liberals ia the room of eleven Tones ? Examiner. The number of candidates at this election who have declared themselves in favour of the Ballot is great beyond all piecedent. The comparison of the electoral duties with those of the juror is the best that can be made. Were the pub- lic morality inculcated by this ornament of the mitre as popular as it is pure, the soliciting of an elector for his vote would be esteemed as gross an indecency as the soliciting a juror for his verdict Examiner. Middlesex ? At the declaration of tbe poll, Mr. Hume asked, ?\u00c2\u00ab have the Middlesex elector* changed? ?has it become indifferent to them whether a mau of liberal opinions, or one wedded to. old \"iWWn* .lirl cor* ruptions, is to represent them ?? or have they preferred a little present advantage to the expectations of great and lasting future benefits to themselves and posterity. Or do they think, that having gained the Reform Bill, it is enough, and they may sit down quietly, and allow its enactments to be carried out, or counteracted, by those who denounced it as the destruction of the Con- stitution? I hope tbat to none of those things is my defeat to be ascribed, but that t s owing to the arts and activity of the Tories. They have, daring the last two years, made 4,000 faggot voters, many of them living in other counties, expressly to swamp the register electors. The register of voters, in 1835, contained 8.005 elec- tors, and the register of 1837, contains 12,817. I may have lost some supporters, but I have gained many more, as I have polled 1,300 or 1.400 more votes at this election than I did at the last. The majority against me are not residents in Middlesex, but men put in the register to answer the purpose the Tories had in view, of possessing themselves of the two seats for this county A letter from Devizes says, \" Since the last General Election upwards of 40 Wiltshire Tories have purchased, or apparently purchased, small tene- ments in the county of Middlesex, purposely to oust Mr. Hume whenever another General Election shall take place. If no check be put to this nefarious system, in the course of a few years England will be one vast rotten Borough.\" Mr. Hume has been returned for the city of Kil- kenny, the poll having been kept open, at Mr. O'Con- nell's request, till the result of the Middlesex election shouM be known. Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Hume, aud Mr. Ewart, bad all been proposed. Southwark Election However we may differ on some questions from Mr. D. W. Harvey, we cannot refrain from noticing his election as a signal triumph of principle over interest, worthy of imitation in every constituency. In his address of thanks for his return, Mr. Harvey says ? \" Mr. John Richards, twice Mem- ber fur Knaresborough, was ushered forth, holding in one band the subscription purse of tbe Tory treasury, and in the other the boasted memorial of his territorial and trading pretensions ; while his official subordinates were industriously promulgating the pure and seductive information, that half the public-houses were engaged in his interest, and at the same time the walls of your borough proclaimed the industry of the press. ? Such were the mighty agencies brought to bear upon au indi- vidual who made no secret of the serious prejudice which a series of rash and censurable contests had worked upon his fortunes, and of bis unalterable reso- lution, not more upon grounds of prudence, than upon principle as a Reformer, that come what might he would not expend oue farthing not actually imposed upon candidates by law.? Your noble and generous con- duct has redeemed all that I ventured to hope, end the country to expect of you Let the proud example shine forth iv tbe testimony of facts to unregenerated constituencies. Throughout this election I have had no committee-room ? no personal committee ; I have neither penned, printed, nor published one card, hand- bill, or address, save my address upon the dissolution of the Parliament. I bave had no solicitor, secretary, or agent ; I have hired neither horse nor man ; I have not even signed one ticket uf admission to the hustings; I have not canvassed nor solicited one vote ; I have given no man a penny or a pot ; I possess not one farthing's worth of property nor any personal connection in your borough ; but this I have, and with you the testimonial was conclusive and complete, a political character, earned by twenty years of consistent and steady devotion to the maintenance and advancement of the civil and religious liberties of my country ? Thus honoured and rewarded, I dedicate my best services to you, and tbe land of my birth.\" ? Mr. Harvey polled 1927, Mr. Humphery 1941, and Mr. Richards only 847. Nouth Wiltshire This contest terminated in the defeat of Mr. Methuen by the renegade Sir Francis Burdett. The numbers were ? Burdett 2,365 ; Long 2,197 ; Methuen 1,876. The Tories had for 10 days uninterrupted possession of the field. Sir Francis de- clared that he calculated on spending 20,000/., and thus the stimulus of gain was applied to the lawyers, who roost efficiently seconded the seal of the clergy. The Wesleyans, too, generally voted wilh the Tories.? Mr. Long, though a supporter of the Irish Church and English Corporation Bills, owed his election to v coalition with Sir Francis Burdett, and the split votes of tbe Tories. He acknowledged that he owed his return to tbe Conservatives and the agriculturists, having been shamefully deserted, he said, by those upon whom he had greater right to rely. He declared that he had great pleasure in having Sir Francis Burdett for his colleague. Eabt Cornwall? At this Election Sir Colman Rashleigh (whose objection to Sir W. Molesworth as too strong in bis opinions was the cause of that gentle- man's retirement) declared, in proposing Sir Hussey Vivian, his late conviction of the necessity of the Ballot. Sir H. Vivian also declared he bad been fully convinced of the necessity of the Ballot during the present election. Many electors had told him they would willingly vote for him, but their landlords would not allow tbem. He was perfectly ready to snpport the Ballot, on a petition to do so from a majority of his constituents. Sir W. Trelawney, who was proposed in the place of Sir Wm. Molesworth, avowed himself a Radical. Lord Eliot was nominated on the Tory side. At the close of the poll the numbers were ? Eliot 2435, Vivian 2288, Trelawney 2245. Thus the disputes between different shades of reformers has let in a thorough-going Tory. East Cumberland The most malignant opponent, because the late adherent, of the Ministers, Sir James Graham, has been signally defeated in this county. At the close of the poll the numbers were ? for Mr. Ag- lionby 2294, Mr. James 2125, Sir J. Graham 1603. The Standard now kicks the fallen Baronet as not free from the leaven of Whiggism, and Uunt\u00c3\u009f him With bis former extreme conduct as a Whig. Belfast Mr. Gibson, reformer, polled 941 ; Lord Belfast, reformer, 922; Mr. E. Teunent .9ol ; Mr. Dunbar, 869. \" This victory (says tbe Not them Whig ) is, in every way, highly important.

Dublin. ? On the day of the declaration of the poli Mr. O'Connell addressed an immense multitude in on; of his most characteristic speeches. He observed. \" When in London I was told that it would be useless for me to stand for Dublin, for the Corporation had ere ared so many rlctitioua freemen? some by birth, wlr. were never the sons of freemen, and others by marriage. who never married the daughters of freemen ? rbat it would be impossible to oust their nominees out of the representation? and most assuredly I would be put down ...We have won the battle nobly; and let me thank you for the peace and Conduct which characterize your de- meanour under excitement of no ordinary kind.

Don't insult any one ? go to your respective homes peaceably and quietly when we shall have done speaking. (Cheers.) Let all go home, and enjoy the triumph of the day with iheir little families. Let there be no bonfires or illumina- tions, for that is all our enemies want, in order that they may be enabled to create a riot, and thereby tarnish our victory.\"? The learned gentleman concluded thus : ? \" The elections in England, generally speaking, are won by bribery, and is it not a consolation for me to know that the weiilth of worlds would not bribe the loyal Irish people ? (Loud cheering.) I saw a man in Tralee myself, who parted with 75/. given him for his vote. He took the money to the Court-house, ami m.i.iiMjr tiisanixnt itlrtimir-h the poor man at the time was not worth twenty-five pence. (Cheers.) At Youghal, where my son John was a can- didate, 35/. were offered to another, and the temptation was nearly proving too much for him, when luckily his wife came in. \u00c2\u00ab Darby,* said she, ' I tell you what, if you take that money, by the virtue of my oath I'il never lay my side along with you. (Cheers and laughter.) I'll take the two younger children in my arms, and let the other two follow me, when I will beg through the world wit'i them, for the same house shall never contain you and me.' The Dublin Evening Post gives the following dis- graceful account of Orange intolerance overpowering even the common sense of decency in the House of God; ? \" On Saturday night a. conspiracy was entered into by several hundred fellows, calling themselves Protestants, to disturb the services in the several churches in the city, and to prevent those clergymen from officiating who had the presumption to exercise their judgment in voting, at the College 'election, for Dr. Stock, the Liberal candidate for the University. Accordingly, at an early hour, about 200 persons as- sembled in St. Bride's church, to insult the Rev. Air. Bermingham. When that gentleman appeared tha yell- ing commenced, and the most infamous names were called out. Tbey then retired, banging the church- doors after them, and crying our, \u00c2\u00ab No Popery, no Popery!' From Bride's about a hundred of the gen- tlemen walked up to St. John's, to insult the Rev. Mr. Bciin. They took tbeir places regularly in the church, and remained quiet while another person, the Rev. Mr. Bourke (a renegade priest !) was officiating; but when Mr. Beim opened his lips, tbe yelling of ? No Popery, no Popery' continued, with cries of ' Turn him out,' ' No castle hacks,' ' He shall not officiate in a Protes- tant place of worship.' The alarm was very great among those people who came peacefully to worship their God. Many females ran away, uproar was kept up in the church wilh the vociferations of these fellows, saying, that they would not leave the church until Mr. Beim was driven out. He observed some persons going up to him, and telling him, that for his personal safety he ought to retire. It was in vain that the Rev. Mr. Fleury went out in his canonicals, and entreated the miscreants to retire quietly, but it was all in vain. Having accomplished their object in this church, a battalion was despatched to Paul's to insult the Rev. Mr. Tyrrell, while some more returned to Bride's to assail the Rev. Mr. Bermingham, on coming out of the church.\" At the nomination for Perthshire, Lord Stormont declared \" he was not a Tory, and would rather be con- sidered a Whig of 1688!\"* We regret to state that young Mr.. Carter, of Ossett, has died in consequence of the severe injuries he received during the Wakefield election riot. An inquest on the body of Mr. Oarter has returned a verdict of \" Manslaughter against some person or per- sons unknown.\" It appeared that the injuries of the deceased were inflicted on his bead witb a broken flag- staff. A relative of Mr. Carter, in going home, parsed some men with Yellow colours, one of whom called out, \" D? n thee, we have nearly killed thy brother-in- law, and I am only sorry we have not done for him.\" An inquest has been held at Canterbury on the body of John Constant, who died in consequence of blows received from a flag-staff, at the election for that city. The jury found a verdict of manslaughter against George Green, who is committed for trial. A large sum of money has been subscribed by the inhabitants of Weymouth, for the purpose of present- ing a piece of plate to their late respected Member, Mr. Fowell Buxton. Mr. Buxton, in bidding farewell to the electors, says ? '? I feel much for your disappoint- ment, of which I have had such numerous and touchiinr testimonies ; much, because this event must be imputed to the timidity of some who, reformers iv heart, have not been able to muster courage enough to brave the gross and unexampled intimidation to which our adver- saries have resorted ; much, because this borough, sig- nalized by the spirit which long has prevailed in it, must now appear to fall into a degrading srate of depen- dence, and sends foith, as its representatives in the great council of the nation, gentlemen who will swell the ranks of that party whose doctrines, however con- scientiously entertained, are, as I firmly believe, hostile to the prosperity and the peace of the nation. But these, my strong and painful feelings, are wholly un- mixed with a single particle of personal mortification. I cannot but exultingly rejoice at my deliverance from duties too heavy for my strength, too arduous for my powers of body and of mind, and fatal to that repose and domestic retirement for which I have long panted.\" SECRET SERVICE MONEY. \" A Question fob the Chancellor or the Ex chequer In the time of war, and during the ' dreadful reign of the Tories,' the Secret Service Money averaged about 12,000/. a-year. The Secret Service Money for the year just ended, being a year cf peace, amounts to 35,000/.! How is this?\" ? 'J org papers. Answer fob the ToaiE\u00c3\u009f.- ? So far from the Secret Service Money during the war being 12,000/. a year, it amounted Iv 1810 to 175,0001. oi. lln 1813 to 155,892/. 14* 1812 Jo 137,4b'\"/. Id*. I 1814 to 135,388/. Oj. But even in tbe year 1823 there was voted for Secret Service Money 50,000/., and actually expended 38.299/. ; in 1824, there was expended 33,678*. ; in 1825, 46,732/. ; in 1826. 55.000/. ; iv 1827, 46,000/. ; iv 1828. 42,000/. ; in 1829, 44,000/. - and in 1830, 44.600/. This brings us down to the Administration of Earl Grey. It must be borne in mind that the Whigs found the country and all Europe in a state of tbe greatest confusion ; but not withstanding all these calls on the Reform Govern- ment, although tbe sum voted for 1831 was 42,000/., the sum expended was only 29,7731. ; just 15,000/. less than was expended by the Tories in 1829 and 1830. From 1831 down to the end of 1833, there was voted 44,325/.. and expended 20,000/. In 1834 there was voted 39,400/., aud expended only 5500. But mark the influence of tbe short interregnum of the Tories. In 1835 the sum voted was 37,360/., and the amount expended rose to 24,500/. In 1836 the sum voted was 36,800/.-, and the sum expended fell to 16,850/. The sum voted for 1837 is 35,900/. ; and we have no doubt that the expenditure will be as moderate as in other years of tbe Reform Government. Are tbe Tories satisfied ? The traffic upon the Liverpool and Manchester Rail- way is increasing at a rapid rate. The increase of passengers during the half-year ending the 30th of June last, over the corresponding half of 1836, was no less than 16,500 ? Liverpool Mercury. There are 20.000 persons out of employment at Paisley, nearly 12,000 of whom have for months past entirely depended ou charity for subsistence, and now require a daily expenditure of 120/. A deputation has been sent from Paisley to London to appeal to the humanity of the English people in their behalf, and a subscriptions has been commenced for their benefit. The Queen has given \u00c2\u00a3200, to the subscription, and Lord Melbourne \u00c2\u00a3100. A respite bas been received at Nottingham for Thomas Greensmith, who was found guilty at the late assizes of strangling his four children, at Basford. The respite has been obtained through the representations made to the Secretary of State by the two medical gentlemen whose opinions as to the sanity of the prisoner the learned Judge, upon the trial could not receive as evidence, as they were \" \"not justified in inferring the sanity or insanity from tbe very acts themselves for which the prisoner stood upon his trial.\" The wretched man received the intelligence with the same degree of apathy be has evinced in his conduct through- out in everything relating to the unhappy affair Morn- ing Advertiser.

{"ocr": "THE LEEDS INTELLIGENCTVR, now objecting me will be satiafied with no view on this subject which is not virtually the same as that of Rome,\u00e2\u0080\u0094ascribing to the church not only an authority of order, such as is our articles, but absolute authority for propounding matters of faith, and requiring its decisions to be received with unquesioning submission by its members. The church ,in their view, is not simply the witness and keeper of Holy Writ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the depository of revealed truth, the authoritative interpreter of scripture, without which scrip luxe is conceived by them speak uncertain sense. But what is this but to suppose that the chtircb is endued with an infallible authority For, unless it can pronounce infallibly, how ran theCbristaln bereqnired to receive its decisions divine truths obligatory oo his faith This notion, however, of church authority will he found to be the root of the objections of this class of theologians to the teaching of all who require that all doctrines should be drawn from scriptures. With them the reference to scripture is heretical principle,\" because It holds up tho authority of scripture over that of the church in all questions of doctrine. Hence that animosity against all who thus establish the articles of faith, and their unchecked boldness In repeating charges of heresy against any confession of faith, however sound in itself, which claims to be simply scriptural in its authority. person in their view is no believer, who does net hold their \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00a2church principles\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, who does not build bis faith the church in their sense. Bnt, my lord, must notice, before I conclude, tbo hollow pretence of those who ore resting their objections to ma on the statute of the University passed in X 836. I think it will be found, that some of those who are urging this point were the most active instruments themselves in carrying that illegal measure. Men are naturally unwilling to acknowledge their wrong. More is the honour due to those excellent persons who have not wished that day of excitement to be remembered against me, but would now gladly erase the record of it. But it is distressing to see that there are others who would fall back on their own wrong and would take a false advantage from it to justify themselves to themselves and to the public. That statute, however, I would observe, has been virtually repealed by two subsequent proceedings in the university ; the first place, by the New Theol gical Statute of 1842, which placed me, as Regius Professor, at the head of a newly constituted board of Theological Examiners; and then, in the same year, by the just act of the chief authorities of the university, with whom rests the initiative of cveiy measure, tho board of heads of houses and proctors, who unanimously proposed form of statute for rescindiug it. So far, then, as the chief responsible body of the university is concerned, 1 relieved of the burden of that statute; though the Tractarian party succeeded, with a very reduced majority, however, in throwing out the measure in convocation. And is not tbe history of that statute perfectly understood ? How can any one venture to put if forward now, when by such act they ore implicating themselves with tbe theology and spirit of its chief promoters ? Every one knows that the editors of tbe Trade, and others following in their wake, were the great instruments in the work of calumny on which it was founded. A pamphlet, full of gross misrepretentation of my writings, the production of Mr. Newman, was circulated through tbe country. And tbo calumnies thus spread abroad concurred with tbe great political excitement of the times in obtaining majority against me; not, however, even then, until after repulse on tbe first assault by the firm and spirited intervention of the proctors. How, then, cun any wish to sympathize or identify themselves with the chief actors of that day ? Where is Mr. Newman now, let ask, the principal mover then ? What are tbe rest doing\u00e2\u0080\u0094bis old associates whom he has left\u00e2\u0080\u0094but training others to imbibe the spirit their great leader, reluctant us they may be to follow him throughout With what real truth, therefore, can it be said tbat, as certain persons seem to take an unenviable pleasure in repeating, lam under the censnre of tbo university 7\u00e2\u0080\u009d 1 am not, my lord, in truth. fact, the statute referred to no opinions or doctrines whatever, but only to the manner of treating theological subjects. When, indeed, censure ot the university passed, certain propositions are selected from tho author's writings, and the decree of convocation condemns those particular propositions. This was done recently in tbo case of Mr. Ward, tbe author of the Ideal of the Christian Church. Nothing of the kind was done in my case; nothing specific was ever alleged against me. Certainly, whatever may have been the first design the statute referred to, it has bad no effect. It has been practically a dead letter. 1 have continued to preach and lecture in the University wiihout any diminution of attendance cr respect on account of it. Divinity Professor before me, I believe, has been better attended, cr received more marks of confideece from bis hearers. Then, lord, if farther witnesses are needed to my character as Christian minister, let the thousands who have beard my sermons and my lectures speak for me. Again, let any of parishioners, who have known my manner of life and conversation now for 12 years past, and my whole ministry among them.\u00e2\u0080\u0094in tbe church, in the school, and from house to house\u00e2\u0080\u0094bo called to give their evidence. Bat let not the public be deluded into rash and false judgment by anonymous slanderers in newspapers. Nor let an undue weight be attributed to meetings convened by circulars sent through tbe conntry, under the instigation of a few individuals, who are for the most part well-known adversaries, not only of me, of all tbat is Protestant in our church.

And further acknowledge jour Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Intention towards us naming and recommbndino unto ns\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the same letters missive Dr. Rcnn Dickson Hampden, your Majesty's Reader in Theology in your University Oxford, to be by us elected and chosen unto the said bishopric.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cut most humbly beseech your Majesty to permit us, as duty bound, and obedience to your Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gracious command touching the qualities of the person to be chosen us, to represent (and, if it be deemed necessary, by sufficient documents to prove), that somewhat more than eleven years ago the said Dr. Renn Dickson Hampden, then being the late King William's Reader Theology, the said University did, by its laws, r? sjtB. and privileges, and by the law of the land it is empowered, and fit occasions bound to do. judge of the published writings of the said Dr. Hampden, and did solemnly decree* and tiy statute in the House Convocation duly made did enact, that the said Dr. Hampden should be deprived of certain weighty functions, importing the right of judging of sound teaching and preaching God's word, which had been specially annexed bv former statutes of the said University to his office therein ; to wit, thaf be the number of those whom are appointed the select preachers before the University,'\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, further, that his counsel be taken case of any preacher being called (as by the statutes the said University every preacher who may have delivered any unsound or suspected doctrine in any of his preachings liable be called) into question before the Vice-Chancellor.\" And such deprivation Dr. Hampden was expressly declared in the said stature to have been decreed, hfcause in hit said published writings has so treated matters theological, that in this respect the University hath no confidence in him.\" Furthermore, six years the Convocation of the said Universitty having been called together to consider the question of the fitness of repealing the said statute, so that the said Dr. Hampden might be lest* red the functionsof which he had been as aforesaid deprived, the said Convocation did thereupon solemnly decree that the statute should not be repealed, but should still be (and, accordingly, it still continues bo) full force and vizeur; whereby the said Dr. Hampden stands to this day denounced by the judgment the said University as devoid altogether of Us confidence in matters theological, by the reason of the manner in which those matters have been treated by him in his published writings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And here wre deem it duty to your Majesty humbly to submit, that not only by the people and church of England, but all your Majesty's Royal predecessors, the solemn decision of your Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Universities of Oxford and Cambridge questions and matters of theology hare always been deemed carry with them very high authority, and that such the renown of these your Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famous Universities throughout the reformed portion of Christendom, that everywhere their judgment is heard with reverence and honour. Neither may omit dutifully to lay before your Majesty, that the office of a bishop, to which we are commanded by your Majesty to chrose parson meet to he elected,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 essentially adheres the duty judging of the doctrine the clergy committed to his charge, especially of those who are to instituted or licensed by him to the cure of souls\u00e2\u0080\u0094which high duty the University of Oxford has decreed, as aforesaid, that Dr. Hampden in its judgment, unfit to have confided to him ; the distressing and disastrous con-equcncc s which must be expected result from placing Hereford, the strong hand of power, under person characterized by high authority, we are unwilling it would bo painful to rocoum. For all these reasons, and not least because. common as believe with almost every considerate churchman, weare desirous and anxious that the prerogative of the Crown in nominating to bishopries should be for ever established its only firm foundation \u00e2\u0080\u0094the confidence of the church in the wisdom, the justice, the purity, the considerate and conscientious moderation with which is exercised ; must humbly pray yonr Majesty to name and recommend some other person whom your Majesty shall think meet to bo elected by us for our bishop, or that your Majesty will graciously relievo us from tho necessity of proceeding the election till you shall have been pleased to submit Dr. Renn Dickson Hampden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s published writings Uo judged as aforesaid by the Convocation of the University of Oxford) to the judgment either nf the two Houses of Convocation of clergy of the province of Canterbury which is now sitting, or of the Provincial Council of Bishops the same province, assisted such divines your Majesty fir the said Provincial Council shall he pleased t\u00c2\u00bb call, or of some other competent tribunal which your Majesty shall be graciously pleased to appoint. order whereunto have appointed for the day of election the 28th day of December instant, being the eleventh day from the receipt of your Majesty's cotuie d'ilire, and the last which can lawfully appoint. And are the more emboldened to lay this our humble supplication at the feet of your Majesty your known cordial attachment to our holy and apostolic church, and your faithful and uniform observance of the oath made yonr Majesty at your coronation, That yon will maintain and preserve to the utmost of your power the doctrine, discipline, and government thereof.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And even if could be imagined that these last-mentioned considerations apply not to our esse, ebonld nevertheless confidently rely on your Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experienced regard for that dearest and most sacred right of every class and description of your subjects, the right of liberty of conscience, and on your having at tho head of your Majesty's councils a noble lord, the prondest boast of whose illustrious bouse, as well as of his own public life, it hitherto has been to assert that right for all men against all opponents\u00e2\u0080\u0094a right which would in onr persona be trampled to the very dust if, in spite of all our Just and reasonable reclamations, coerced under the threatened penalties of pramunire to elect for our bishop a person whom we cannot conscientiously believe, long as the aforesaid judgment stands against him, to be\u00e2\u0080\u009d meet to be elected\u00e2\u0080\u009d to that most holy office. In conclusion would add our fervent prayer, os well as onr most earnest hope, that your Majesty may long permitted by the King of Kings reign in the hearts of all your subjects the approved \u00e2\u0080\u009cDefender of the Faith,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ruling all estates and degrees of men amongst us, whether ecclesiastical or temporal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as is your sacred and undoubted right,\u00e2\u0080\u0094giving alike to all experience of the blessings of your just and beneficent government, andreceiving from ail the willing homage of grateful and confiding love. In witness whereuntu have affixed our decanal seal this 17th day of December, in the year of onr Lord 1847. (L.S.) The year 1847, it has been observed, will be'memorable as one of the most disastrous in our mercantile annals. A decline in consols from 100 to 79 represents depreciation in the public securities of \u00c2\u00a3168,000,000. The fall in railway shares, estimated at fifty per cent, shows a dimlnutionof \u00c2\u00a360,000,000 in the value of this property. The failure of commercial establishments is probably understated at \u00c2\u00a320,000,000. The loss East and West India produce, machinery, and manufactured articles, is computed at \u00c2\u00a3100,000,000. It is difficult to estimate the actual depreciation of colonial property plantations and buildings; some have raised it as high as \u00c2\u00a3400,000,000, and if this prove correct, the loss of imperial treasure during this year does not fall far short of the national debt.

The following circular has been issued by Thomas Sands.\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Lirerpool, December ISth, 1847. Sir, \u00e2\u0080\u0094It ia with much concern I am under the necessity of informing you that, consequence of the difficulty of obtaining remittances, the fall in the value of property, and still more, the misappropriation of funds by those who were associated with me in joint transactions, it has become necessary for firm of Thomas and Joseph Sands and Co. to suspend payment; but trust I may state that the creditors will receive the full amount of their claims. It is the same time due to the bouse of Sands, Turner, and Co., in which I am interested, to say that the affairs that firm and of Thomas and Joseph Sands and Co. are totally distinct, and that Sands, Turner, and Co. will ways be affected by the event that has occurred. Indeed, the amount coming to me from that firm will form ajargeitem in my assets. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2* A statement of the affairs of my firm shall prepared early as possible and laid before the creditors.

Horrible Narrative.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We extract the following from the Halifax Morning Post of the let instant:\u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2* The schooner Caroline, fiom Savannah for Bath, encountered heavy gales after the -bth of October, had all her provisions washed over, and on the ulr. the crew had been six days without food or water. In this situation they cast lots as to who should die to save the lives of the others, and the lot fell on large Irishman, tamed Charles Brown, who was the only man with a knife board, and threatened to plunge it into any one who would attempt to carry out the fatal chance Hereupon a lad of nineteen, belonging to Wales, offered to die first, as he was the youngest, and Brown was about to stick him with his knife, when the captain struck Brown with an adze, and killed him. They drew off his blood and drank it. cutting his body in stripes to eat. On the morning the 13th three vessels hove in sight, and the three survivors were rescued, their lives beyond doubt having been saved by drinking the horrid liquid. Two of the survivors \u00c2\u00bb Philadelphia, the other one was a vessel bound for the West Indies.** Threat to Shoot Lord G.

When at the station he said he could not help it, Lord George opposed Lord John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s measures, and was gambling scoundrel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He talked a good deal more incoherent nonsense of the same kind, and it appeared that the unhappy man bad before been in custody on a charge of threatening Sir H.

Fatal Affray Stockport.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Stockport, Dgc. 18.\u00e2\u0080\u0094This afternoon an inquest was held touching the death of James Bown, who met his death on Thursday morning last, during election riot. The inquisition was held the Court House, before Mr. Uu Ison and a Jury selected from both political parties.

Mr, John Rayner, F,R,C.S.E., surgeon of Stockport Infirmary, deposed to the nature the injuries sustained the deceased, and from his description and enumeration of the wounds upon the head and body, it appeared that the unfortunate man had been most savagely maltreated. L-real Wilkinson, who stated himself to have been an eyewitness of the transaction, described the death as having been perpetrated repeated blows with instruments called \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 picking-pegs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he identified the prisocer one five men whom he had seen committing the outrage Frances Hibberc also swore the prisoner as being the who struck the deceased the first blow with a \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 picking-peg,\u00e2\u0080\u009d after which the deceased, when incapable resistance, was beaten in such a cruel manner that his death endued few minutes.

APPLEBY FAT FAIR.\u00e2\u0080\u0094This improving fair was held on Thursday, the 5th instant, when a large stock of cattle of all descriptions was shown, and a great many dealers were in from different parts. Fat cattle and lambs brought good prices; also calving cows were much looked after, but those of inferior quality did not meet with purchasers. Upon the whole the fair was considered good at this season of the year when the farmers are all busy with their hay. In this neighbourhood the hay harvest is very back, the weather still continues unfavourable; to-day, the rain fell in torrents which has done a great deal of damage both to corn and hay. At Hexham, on the llth instant, a fine boy, about four years of age, son of William Lisle, a labourer at the Railway Station, died of hydrophobia, occasioned by the bite of a dog about a fortnight ago. Ths workmen employed in removing the houses built against the end of tbe Abbey Church at Hexham, have within the last few days discovered two very interesting coins amongst the rubbish.

SUPPOSED MURDER AT NEWCASTLE.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Early on Wednesday morning last, a woman was found lying in Blue Anchor Chare, leading to the Quay, Newcastle, in a senseless state, with her head covered with blood, and bearing other marks of ill usage. She was removed to a neighbouring public-house, where she died in a few minutes afterwards, under circumstances which at present appear to warrant the presumption that she was the victim of murder.\u00e2\u0080\u0094She was the wife of John Anderson, mariner, and was 42 years of age. A Coroner's inquest was held on the body, and a variety of testimony produced to show that her death had been caused by foul means; but the evidence not being complete, the inquest was adjourned till Tuesday next. A woman named Margaret Donaldson is in custody as being implicated in the affair. The Bishop of Durham has subscribed \u00c2\u00a350 towards the contemplated restoration of Hexham Abbey.

Several persons were drinking the kitchen tbe time, the murder is supposed to have been committed, as about quarter past ten the eldest daughter entered the kitchen, and desired the company to make haste and drink their ale and withdraw, as her father was very ill in the yard, and they wanted to put him to bed, which they could not do without bringing the body through the kitchen.

Propau A Lis Trees.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A new plan for increasing plantations apple trees has lately been carried into extensive practice by tbe horticulturists of Bohemia. Neither seed nor grafting is required. The process is take shoots from the choicest sorts, insert them in a potatoe, and plunge both into the ground, leaving hut inch or two of the shoot above the surface. The potatoe nourishes the shoot, while it pushes out roots, and the shoot gradually grows and becomes beautiful tree, hearing the best fruit without grafted. Whatever may the success of tbe undertaking, its novelty at least inducement give it fair trial. Lambs at Port Philip.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Some idea may be formed of the excellence of the pasture for sheep at Port Philip from the following fact.

She called up her confidential maid-servant to her bed-side, and, whispering in a low tone, said, \" Jane, am dying, hut make no noise, because, if you do, Mr. Ramsey will be awoke. You know that when bis slumbers are broken he grows nervous, and cannot go to sleep again ; but do you leave me now, and come in at tbe usual hour in the morning; you will find me dead, and he will have had his usual allowance of sleep.\" She died as was anticipated.

Dennis, brother of the former witness of that name, asked if Mr. Boggis had not been sworn at the True- Blue Club, at the Waggon and Horses? Mr. Smythies. Did I wish to perjure myself I should say he was. I believe he was sworn at mv house, and appointed a Deputy, Mr. Alderman Edwa.il ('lay, the late Mayor, who served during the year. Mr. B. went home to Baddow. He had been elected, without a poll being demanded, in Sept. 1821. [The. oath taken by the Major was here read.] The Deputy- Mayor is appointed by deed, under the seal. Tbe last Deputy was appointed \u00bb month ago, when the Mayor was from home; he appointed Mr. Clay ; the power is on the average exercised once in each mayoralty, and tbe appointment is generally only for a day or two. When Alderman C__j was Mayor _a met with aa acci- dent, anal appointed him brother, who acted for the re- maining three months, in 1328. Alderman John Bridge was elected Mayor in 1812. and it was after- ward- discovered, that tbe mode hitherto punned in electing officers was not in accordance with tbe then existing charter, that his former titles of Alderman. Assistant, and Common-Councilman were all defective, and this being the ease with several other members of tbe Corporate Body, they were virtually dissolved. Legal questions arose as to these defects, and in the person of Mr. Alderman Smith tbe matter was decided. The Corporation was from that time dissolved \u00bb and, on their petitioning, the present governing charter was obtained. There never had been an instance of _ Mayor having been removed ; several gentlemen have served the office more than once \u2014 the present Mayor was now serving the office for the sixth time ; none had ever served two years in succession. John Clay had served twice, and Edward Clay three times , ou one occason they could not get a Mayor, and an Alder- man presided. The Mayor presides at all assemblages of the burgesses, is returning officer at elections, is judge of the Admiralty Court, and in other local Courts, with the assistance of the Recorder. He has no salary, but tbe Corporation allow bim ?.01. for his inauguration dinner ; tbis sum bad varied ; it had beau tOt., 40., and once 100 C, but it bad been latterly filed at 80f.; it has never been 1*01.; I do dot wish to s*v that this sum has never been made a source of profit ; but, generally, the expences of the office were very great, from donations to the different charities, mia other subscriptions in the shape of allowances ; it unit cost Mr. Alderman Sparling, during bis mayoralty, nearly SOOf. All the professional men in the town were generally invited to the dinner. A person observed. \" All the Corporation aids of tbe question, Mr. Smythies.\" Mr. Smythies. I should say Mr. Sparling invited persons of all parties iudiscrimiuately. The office is not sought after, on tbe contrary, it is general'- diffi- cult to get gentlemen to serve the office. The deputy', oath is the same as tbe Mayor's, and he performs 'all the duties of tha Mayor. In actions that are brought into the local courts, if the plaintiff be a non-ire__uu_ or foreigner, the Mayor's tee is 1\u00ab. ; if a freeman, the fee is only 6d. He had another emolument for affixis? tho seal, the sum was .*>\u00ab. but 10*. 67.. was general. * paid. The Alderman have no fees or emoluments whatever. The High Stew*. no is elected by the burgrs.es at large paying scot and lot ; ha hold- his office for Ufa as are all the office* uuder tbe Corporation, except tha Recorder and Town Clerk ; the High Steward is out necessarily a ftee-burgwa; he baa no duties to per- form ; be generally attends tba procassioos after tb_ election of tha Mayor, and diaae. Ha baa no _al_rv or emolument. Tvs R-cordbr U elected by the burgesses paving scot and lot ; tbe present Recorder waa elected in December, 183*. in tbe room of Mr. Kelly, who waa preceded by Sergeant RunningUm. Sergeant R. was the Recorder named in the charter. At Sergeant Run- nington s election he was opposed by Mr. D W Harvey, and on tbe Scrutiny which followed,* the for* mer was duly elected sby the old charter it w M not necessary that the Recorder should bo a Barrister h* holds the office for life aud appoints the Town Clerk he has a salary of 6.. 13s. 4d. a year, which has neve- been paid to the present Recorder ; and it hiw been '\u00bb matter of conversation among the select body tbat it ought to be augmented to twenty guineas, merely to- meet the expenses. Sergeant Runnington, in addition to this sum, was paid ten or twelve guineas every tiro* be attended. 11 is deputy wns also paid; Mr Kellv only received the salary ; he attended till he <*ot into ill health; the Recorder or his dej.uty \u00bblwavs\u00b0att_nd< four times in tho year, and also at the sweating in of the Mayor on Michaelmas day. as directed by tho charter. [The Recorder's oath was here read.] He atteuds on all occasions prescribed by tho charter \u2022 he i\u00bb required to uttend the trial of civil actions in the local courts. On. had only been brought since the late au- pointment, aud on that occasion the parties were wis\u00a9 enough to settle their differences without the interven tion of the law. The deputy Recorder .3 appointed by deed ; the present has no deputy ; he had acted a* deputy to Mr. Kelly. v as The Four Justices or the Peac. are elected under a prescriptive right exercised anterior to the er-minJ of any charter; they are elected by 24 h\u00ab_dm_llf I hey have no salary, and devote a great deal of the?; lime to the duties of their office.
